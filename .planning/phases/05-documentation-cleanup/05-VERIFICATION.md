| `agents/config/schema.py` | PipelineConfig model with base_url | ✓ VERIFIED | PipelineConfig class with base_url (default: http://localhost:8080) and lookback_hours |
| `generators/feed_generator.py` | FeedGenerator using configurable base_url | ✓ VERIFIED | __init__ accepts base_url param, self.base_url used throughout, no hardcoded news.aatf.ai |
| `config/providers.yaml` | Configuration with pipeline section | ✓ VERIFIED | 107 lines with pipeline section, base_url and lookback_hours documented |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| Navigation.svelte | /about | href link | ✓ WIRED | `href="/about"` with active state logic for pathname === '/about' |
| Footer.svelte | /about | href link (2x) | ✓ WIRED | Two About links: navigation area + AI disclaimer section |
| FeedGenerator | PipelineConfig | base_url parameter | ✓ WIRED | __init__ accepts base_url, uses self.base_url throughout |
| run_pipeline.py | FeedGenerator | config pass-through | ✓ WIRED | `base_url=pipeline_config.base_url` passed to FeedGenerator constructor |
| README.md | providers.yaml | documentation reference | ✓ WIRED | 8 references to providers.yaml in Configuration and Quick Start sections |
| README.md | prompts.yaml | documentation reference | ✓ WIRED | Prompt Customization section + directory structure reference |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Supporting Evidence |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| DOC-01: Remove all RDSec references | ✓ SATISFIED | grep returns empty for source files (only .planning/ has research notes) |
| DOC-02: Rewrite README for external audience | ✓ SATISFIED | README is 368 lines with Quick Start, Configuration, Architecture |
| DOC-03: Update .env.example for public use | ⚠️ N/A | No .env.example file; configuration is in providers.yaml (better approach) |
| DOC-04: Add Apache 2.0 LICENSE file | ✓ SATISFIED | LICENSE exists with Apache 2.0 text and AATF copyright |
| DOC-05: Convert logo.png to logo.webp | ✓ SATISFIED | Both logo.png (921KB) and logo.webp (13KB) exist in web/assets and frontend/static/assets |
| DOC-06: Document provider modes in README | ✓ SATISFIED | README has LLM Provider and Image Provider sections with mode examples |
| DOC-07: Document prompt customization in README | ✓ SATISFIED | README has "Prompt Customization" section with config/prompts.yaml reference |

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None detected in source code.**

Scanned files modified in Phase 5:
- agents/llm_client.py
- generators/hero_generator.py
- CLAUDE.md
- LICENSE
- frontend/src/routes/about/+page.svelte
- frontend/src/lib/components/layout/Footer.svelte
- frontend/src/lib/components/layout/Navigation.svelte
- agents/config/schema.py
- generators/feed_generator.py
- config/providers.yaml
- run_pipeline.py
- README.md

All files have substantive content, no stub patterns, no TODO/FIXME comments in implementation code.

### Human Verification Required

While automated verification confirms all structural and content requirements are met, the following items benefit from human visual verification:

#### 1. About Page Layout and Readability

**Test:** Start dev server (`cd frontend && npm run dev`), navigate to http://localhost:5173/about  
**Expected:** 
- Page renders with 4 sections: About This Project, How It Works, AI-Generated Content Disclaimer, Open Source
- AI disclaimer is visually prominent with warning styling
- All sections use consistent card styling with dark mode support
- Text is readable and formatted correctly

**Why human:** Visual layout, typography, and color scheme require human assessment for quality and accessibility.

#### 2. Navigation About Link (Responsive)

**Test:** 
- Desktop: Visit site, check top navigation bar for About link
- Mobile: Resize browser to mobile width (< 640px), verify About link hidden from nav

**Expected:**
- Desktop: About link visible after Archive link, active state when on /about
- Mobile: About link not visible in top nav (accessible via footer instead)

**Why human:** Responsive behavior requires testing at different viewport sizes.

#### 3. Footer AI Disclaimer

**Test:** Scroll to bottom of any page  
**Expected:**
- Footer shows "Content generated by AI. May contain errors."
- Footer contains clickable "About" link in navigation area
- Footer contains "Learn more" link in disclaimer section
- Both links navigate to /about

**Why human:** Visual placement and link functionality best verified interactively.

#### 4. README Comprehensibility

**Test:** Read README.md as if you're an external developer wanting to deploy the project  
**Expected:**
- Quick Start section provides clear Docker and local development paths
- Configuration section explains provider modes with examples
- Architecture section gives sufficient context without overwhelming detail
- No confusion about what RDSec is (no references should exist)

**Why human:** Documentation clarity and completeness are subjective qualities best assessed by a fresh reader.

### Gaps Summary

**No gaps found.** All 10 observable truths verified, all 8 required artifacts substantive and wired, all 6 key links functioning, 6/7 requirements satisfied (DOC-03 N/A due to better design choice).

The codebase is ready for public open-source release.
