# Phase 05 Plan 02: About Page and AI Disclaimer Summary

**One-liner:** Created About page with AI-generated content disclaimer, added AI disclaimer to footer with About link, and desktop-only About link in navigation.

## What Was Built

### About Page (`/about`)
A comprehensive About page with four sections:
1. **About This Project** - Explains AATF AI News Aggregator purpose and origin
2. **How It Works** - Describes the 5-step multi-agent pipeline
3. **AI-Generated Content Disclaimer** - Prominent warning about AI limitations
4. **Open Source** - Links to GitHub repo, mentions Apache 2.0 license

The disclaimer section uses an amber border and warning icon to draw attention.

### Footer Updates
- Added `[About]` link in the nav area (next to RSS)
- Added AI disclaimer section at bottom: "Content generated by AI. May contain errors. Learn more"
- The "Learn more" links to the About page

### Navigation Updates
- Added "About" link after Archive in desktop navigation
- Hidden on mobile (`hidden sm:block`) - mobile users access via footer
- Active state styling when on `/about` path

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification

All requirements met:
- [x] About page accessible at /about route (146 lines, exceeds min 50)
- [x] About page contains AI disclaimer section
- [x] Footer displays brief AI disclaimer text
- [x] Footer contains working About link (2 links)
- [x] Navigation shows About link on desktop only (hidden sm:block)
- [x] All components follow existing Tailwind styling patterns
- [x] No TypeScript/Svelte compilation errors in modified files

Note: Pre-existing TypeScript errors exist in feeds/+page.svelte (unrelated to this plan).

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for next plan. No blockers.
