Author Valentina Alto brings practical, industry-grounded expertise in AI Agents in Practice to help you go beyond simple chatbots and create AI agents that plan, reason, collaborate, and solve real-world problems using large language models (LLMs) and the latest open-source frameworks.\n\nIn this book, you'll get a comparative tour of leading AI agent frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph, covering each tool's strengths, ideal use cases, and how to apply them in real-world projects. Through step-by-step examples, you’ll learn how to construct single-agent and multi-agent architectures using proven design patterns to orchestrate AI agents working together. Case studies across industries will show you how AI agents drive value in real-world scenarios, while guidance on responsible AI will help you implement ethical guardrails from day one.
