      "content": "OpenAI’s annualised revenue has surged past $20 billion in 2025, up from $2 billion in 2023, as the company rapidly expands its compute capacity, according to a new statement by Sarah Friar, chief financial officer of OpenAI.\n\n\n\nIn a company blog post, Friar said OpenAI has structured its business model so that revenue growth increases in step with the practical value its AI systems generate, tying financial performance directly to the amount of real-world work carried out using its technology.\n\n\n\nCompute capacity has grown roughly threefold year over year, reaching about 1.9 gigawatts in 2025, compared with 0.2 GW in 2023, while revenue expanded at a similar pace to exceed $20 billion ARR.\n\n\n\n“Our ability to serve customers—as measured by revenue—directly tracks available compute,” Friar wrote, adding that greater access to compute in earlier years would likely have driven even faster adoption and monetisation.\n\n\n\nOpenAI said both daily and weekly active users are at all-time highs, driven by ChatGPT’s transition from a consumer curiosity to what Friar described as “infrastructure that helps people create more, decide faster, and operate at a higher level.”\n\n\n\nInitially launched as a research preview, ChatGPT is now embedded in everyday personal and professional workflows, from education and writing to software development, marketing, and finance. That usage shift shaped OpenAI’s commercial strategy, starting with consumer subscriptions, expanding to team and enterprise plans, and adding usage-based pricing for developers through its API platform.\n\n\n\n“As AI moved into teams and workflows, we created workplace subscriptions and added usage-based pricing so costs scale with real work getting done,” Friar said.\n\n\n\nMore recently, OpenAI has extended its model to advertising and commerce, positioning ChatGPT as a decision-making platform where users move from exploration to action. Friar stressed that ads and commercial options are only introduced when they are “clearly labelled and genuinely useful,” arguing that monetisation must feel native to the product experience.\n\n\n\nAt the core of OpenAI’s financial strategy is compute management. Friar called compute “the scarcest resource in AI,” noting that OpenAI has moved from reliance on a single provider to a diversified ecosystem of partners.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn January, OpenAI signed a $10-billion deal with chipmaker Cerebras Systems, turning its focus to inference infrastructure.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, Friar said OpenAI’s financial focus will be on practical adoption, particularly in health, science, and enterprise use cases where improved intelligence can directly translate into measurable outcomes. She also signalled future revenue models beyond subscriptions and APIs, including licensing, IP-based agreements, and outcome-based pricing, as AI expands into areas such as drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modelling.\nThe post OpenAI Hits $20 Bn ARR Mark as Compute Capacity Triples: CFO Sarah Friar appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

The service is available via the AutoGo app.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe launch follows the partners securing a fully driverless commercial permit in mid-November 2025.\n\n\n\nThe initial operations cover Yas Island, which has been designated as a permitted zone for fully driverless operations. The companies said the service will expand in phases across Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\nThe next phase will include Al Reem Island, Al Maryah Island, and Saadiyat Island. The partners said they will add more areas over time. The long-term plan is to operate across the wider Abu Dhabi emirate and deploy hundreds of vehicles by 2026.\n\n\n\nBaidu said the collaboration with AutoGo began in March 2025. The partners announced plans then to build Abu Dhabi’s largest fully driverless fleet. By mid-November 2025, they secured one of the first permits for fully driverless commercial operations in the emirate.\n\n\n\nUsers can now download the app and request a ride, and the vehicles will operate without a human driver.\n\n\n\n“This speed of execution highlights the technical readiness of Apollo Go, the strong operational capabilities of our partnership, and the steadfast support of local regulatory bodies,” said Liang Zhang, managing director of EMEA at Baidu Apollo.\n\n\n\nAutoGo said the launch marks a shift from testing to public deployment. The company said it plans to expand services across key districts in phases. The partners said they will continue scaling the service to reach more users. They also said the deployment aligns with Abu Dhabi’s broader smart city goals.\n\n\n\n“AutoGo’s transition to live robotaxi operations marks an important milestone in Abu Dhabi’s autonomous mobility journey,” said Sean Teo, managing director of K2. “Launching the service at the start of the year reflects our focus on execution and long-term value creation.”\n\n\n\n“By introducing robotaxi services in real urban environments and scaling across key districts, we are moving decisively from development to deployment—delivering autonomy that is practical, safe, and ready for everyday use,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe company said Apollo Go has logged more than 240 million autonomous kilometres globally. More than 140 million kilometres were completed in fully driverless mode.\n\n\n\nApollo Go operates in 22 cities worldwide, according to the company. Its weekly ride count has surpassed 2.5 lakh. The service has completed more than 17 million cumulative rides as of October 31, 2025.\n\n\n\nIt has also previously partnered with Uber and CAR Inc in China.\nThe post Baidu’s Apollo Go &amp; AutoGo Launch Fully Autonomous Ride-Hailing in Abu Dhabi appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "content": "Nous Research has introduced NousCoder-14B, a competitive olympiad programming model that is post trained on Qwen3-14B using reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. On the LiveCodeBench v6 benchmark, which covers problems from 08/01/2024 to 05/01/2025, the model reaches a Pass@1 accuracy of 67.87 percent. This is 7.08 percentage points higher than the Qwen3-14B baseline of 60.79 percent on the same benchmark. The research team trained the model on 24k verifiable coding problems using 48 B200 GPUs over 4 days, and released the weights under the Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face.\n\n\n\nhttps://nousresearch.com/nouscoder-14b-a-competitive-olympiad-programming-model/\n\n\nBenchmark focus and what Pass@1 means\n\n\n\nLiveCodeBench v6 is designed for competitive programming evaluation. The test split used here contains 454 problems. The training set uses the same recipe as the DeepCoder-14B project from Agentica and Together AI. It combines problems from TACO Verified, PrimeIntellect SYNTHETIC 1, and LiveCodeBench problems created before 07/31/2024. \n\n\n\nThe benchmark only includes competitive programming style tasks. For each problem, a solution must respect strict time and memory limits and must pass a large set of hidden input output tests. Pass@1 is the fraction of problems where the first generated program passes all tests, including time and memory constraints. \n\n\n\nhttps://nousresearch.com/nouscoder-14b-a-competitive-olympiad-programming-model/\n\n\nDataset construction for execution based RL\n\n\n\nAll datasets used for training are composed of verifiable code generation problems. Each problem has a reference implementation and many test cases. The training set contains 24k problems drawn from:\n\n\n\n\nTACO Verified\n\n\n\nPrimeIntellect SYNTHETIC 1\n\n\n\nLiveCodeBench problems that come before 07/31/2024\n\n\n\n\nThe test set is LiveCodeBench v6, which has 454 problems between 08/01/2024 and 05/01/2025. \n\n\n\nEvery problem is a complete competitive programming task with a description, input format, output format, and test cases. This setup is important for RL because it gives a binary reward signal that is cheap to compute once the code has run.\n\n\n\nRL environment with Atropos and Modal\n\n\n\nThe RL environment is built using the Atropos framework. NousCoder-14B is prompted using the standard LiveCodeBench prompt format, and it generates Python code for each problem. Each rollout receives a scalar reward that depends on test case results:\n\n\n\n\nReward 1 when the generated code passes all test cases for that problem\n\n\n\nReward −1 when the code outputs a wrong answer, exceeds a 15 second time limit, or exceeds a 4 GB memory limit on any test case\n\n\n\n\nTo execute untrusted code safely and at scale, the team uses Modal as an autoscaled sandbox. The system launches one Modal container per rollout in the main design that the research team describes as the used setting. Each container runs all test cases for that rollout. This avoids mixing training compute with verification compute and keeps the RL loop stable. \n\n\n\nThe research team also pipelines inference and verification. When an inference worker finishes a generation, it sends the completion to a Modal verifier and immediately starts a new generation. With many inference workers and a fixed pool of Modal containers, this design keeps the training loop inference compute bound instead of verification bound.\n\n\n\nThe team discusses 3 verification parallelization strategies. They explore one container per problem, one per rollout, and one per test case. They finally avoid the per test case setting because of container launch overhead and use an approach where each container evaluates many test cases and focuses on a small set of the hardest test cases first. If any of these fail, the system can stop verification early. \n\n\n\nGRPO objectives, DAPO, GSPO, and GSPO+\n\n\n\nNousCoder-14B uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) which does not require a separate value model. On top of GRPO the research team test 3 objectives: Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), and a modified GSPO variant called GSPO+. \n\n\n\nAll 3 objectives share the same definition of advantage. The advantage for each rollout is the reward for that rollout normalized by the mean and standard deviation of rewards inside the group. DAPO applies importance weighting and clipping at the token level, and introduces three main changes relative to GRPO:\n\n\n\n\nA clip higher rule that increases exploration for low probability tokens\n\n\n\nA token level policy gradient loss that gives each token equal weight\n\n\n\nDynamic sampling, where groups that are all correct or all incorrect are dropped because they carry zero advantage\n\n\n\n\nGSPO moves the importance weighting to the sequence level. It defines a sequence importance ratio that aggregates token ratios over the whole program. GSPO+ keeps sequence level correction, but it rescales gradients so that tokens are weighted equally regardless of sequence length.\n\n\n\nOn LiveCodeBench v6, the differences between these objectives are modest. At a context length of 81,920 tokens, DAPO reaches a Pass@1 of 67.87 percent while GSPO and GSPO+ reach 66.26 percent and 66.52 percent. At 40,960 tokens, all 3 objectives cluster around 63 percent Pass@1. \n\n\n\nIterative context extension and overlong filtering\n\n\n\nQwen3-14B supports long context and the training follows an iterative context extension schedule. The team first trains the model with a 32k context window and then continues training at the maximum Qwen3-14B context window of 40k. At each stage they select the checkpoint with the best LiveCodeBench score at 40k context and then use YaRN context extension at evaluation time to reach 80k tokens, that is 81,920 tokens.\n\n\n\nA key trick is overlong filtering. When a generated program exceeds the maximum context window, they reset its advantage to zero. This removes that rollout from the gradient signal rather than penalizing it. The research team report that this approach avoids pushing the model toward shorter solutions for purely optimization reasons and helps maintain quality when they scale context length at test time. \n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nNousCoder 14B is a Qwen3-14B based competitive programming model trained with execution based RL, it reaches 67.87 percent Pass@1 on LiveCodeBench v6, a 7.08 percentage point gain over the Qwen3-14B baseline of 60.79 percent on the same benchmark.\n\n\n\nThe model is trained on 24k verifiable coding problems from TACO Verified, PrimeIntellect SYNTHETIC-1, and pre 07 31 2024 LiveCodeBench tasks, and evaluated on a disjoint LiveCodeBench v6 test set of 454 problems from 08/01/2024 to 05/01/2025.\n\n\n\nThe RL setup uses Atropos, with Python solutions executed in sandboxed containers, a simple reward of 1 for solving all test cases and minus 1 for any failure or resource limit breach, and a pipelined design where inference and verification run asynchronously.\n\n\n\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization objectives DAPO, GSPO, and GSPO+ are used for long context code RL, all operate on group normalized rewards, and show similar performance, with DAPO reaching the best Pass@1 at the longest 81,920 token context.\n\n\n\nThe training uses iterative context extension, first at 32k then at 40k tokens, along with YaRN based extension at evaluation time to 81,920 tokens, includes overlong rollout filtering for stability, and ships as a fully reproducible open stack with Apache 2.0 weights and RL pipeline code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Model Weights and Technical details. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content": "Inside large banks, artificial intelligence has moved into a category once reserved for payment systems, data centres, and core risk controls. At JPMorgan Chase, AI is framed as infrastructure the bank believes it cannot afford to neglect.\nThat position came through clearly in recent comments from CEO Jamie Dimon, who defended the bank&#8217;s rising technology budget and warned that institutions that fall behind on AI risk losing ground to competitors. The argument was not about replacing people but about staying functional in an industry where speed, scale, and cost discipline matter every day.\nJPMorgan has been investing heavily in technology for years, but AI has changed the tone of that spending. What once sat with innovation projects is now folded into the bank&#8217;s baseline operating costs. That includes internal AI tools that support research, document drafting, internal reviews, and other routine tasks in the organisation.\nFrom experimentation to infrastructure\nThe shift in language reflects a deeper change in how the bank views risk. AI is considered part of the systems required to keep pace with competitors that are automating internal work.\nRather than encouraging workers to rely on public AI systems, JPMorgan has focused on building and governing its own internal platforms. That decision reflects long-held concerns in banking about data exposure, client confidentiality, and regulatory monitoring.\nBanks operate in an environment where mistakes carry high costs. Any system that touches sensitive data or influences choices must be auditable and explainable. Public AI tools, trained on datasets and updated frequently, make that difficult. Internal systems give JPMorgan more control, even if they take longer to deploy.\nThe approach also reduces the potential of uncontrolled &#8220;shadow AI,&#8221; in which employees use unapproved tools to speed up work. While such tools can improve productivity, they create gaps in oversight that regulators tend to notice quickly.\nA cautious approach to workforce change\nJPMorgan has been careful in how it talks about AI&#8217;s impact on jobs. The bank has avoided claims that AI will dramatically reduce headcount. Instead, it presents AI as a way to reduce manual work and improve consistency.\nTasks that once required multiple review cycles can now be completed faster, with employees still responsible for final judgement. The framing positions AI as support not substitution, which matters in a sector sensitive to political and regulatory reaction.\nThe scale of the organisation makes this approach practical. JPMorgan employs hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Even tiny efficiency gains, applied broadly, can translate into meaningful cost savings over time.\nThe upfront investment required to build and maintain internal AI systems is substantial. Dimon acknowledges that technology spending can have an impact on short-term performance, especially when market conditions are uncertain.\nHis response is that cutting back on technology now may improve margins in the near term, but it risks weakening the bank&#8217;s position later. In that sense, AI spending is treated as a form of insurance against falling behind.\nJPMorgan, AI, and the risk of falling behind rivals\nJPMorgan&#8217;s stance reflects pressure in the banking sector. Rivals are investing in AI to speed up fraud detection, streamline compliance work, and improve internal reporting. As these tools become more common, expectations rise.\nRegulators may assume banks have access to advanced monitoring systems. Clients may expect faster responses and fewer errors. In that environment, lagging on AI can look less like caution and more like mismanagement.\nJPMorgan has not suggested that AI will solve structural challenges or eliminate risk. Many AI projects struggle to move beyond narrow uses, and integrating them into complex systems remains difficult.\nThe harder work lies in governance. Deciding which teams can use AI, under what conditions, and with what oversight requires clear rules. Errors need defined escalation paths. Responsibility must be assigned when systems produce flawed output.\nAcross large enterprises, AI adoption is not limited by access to models or computing power, but constrained by process, policy, and trust.\nFor other end-user companies, JPMorgan&#8217;s approach offers a useful reference point. AI is treated as part of the machinery that keeps the organisation running.\nThat does not guarantee success. Returns may take years to appear, and some investments will not pay off. But the bank&#8217;s position is that the greater risk lies in doing too little, not too much.\n(Photo by IKECHUKWU JULIUS UGWU)\nSee also: Banks operationalise as Plumery AI launches standardised integration\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Instead, it presents AI as a way to reduce manual work and improve consistency.</p>\n<p>Tasks that once required multiple review cycles can now be completed faster, with employees still responsible for final judgement. The framing positions AI as support not substitution, which matters in a sector sensitive to political and regulatory reaction.</p>\n<p>The scale of the organisation makes this approach practical. JPMorgan employs hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Even tiny efficiency gains, applied broadly, can translate into meaningful cost savings over time.</p>\n<p>The upfront investment required to build and maintain internal AI systems is substantial. Dimon acknowledges that technology spending can have an impact on short-term performance, especially when market conditions are uncertain.</p>\n<p>His response is that cutting back on technology now may improve margins in the near term, but it risks weakening the bank’s position later. In that sense, AI spending is treated as a form of insurance against falling behind.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan, AI, and the risk of falling behind rivals</p>\n<p>JPMorgan’s stance reflects pressure in the banking sector. Rivals are investing in AI to speed up fraud detection, streamline compliance work, and improve internal reporting. As these tools become more common, expectations rise.</p>\n<p>Regulators may assume banks have access to advanced monitoring systems. Clients may expect faster responses and fewer errors. In that environment, lagging on AI can look less like caution and more like mismanagement.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan has not suggested that AI will solve structural challenges or eliminate risk. Many AI projects struggle to move beyond narrow uses, and integrating them into complex systems remains difficult.</p>\n<p>The harder work lies in governance. Deciding which teams can use AI, under what conditions, and with what oversight requires clear rules. Errors need defined escalation paths. Responsibility must be assigned when systems produce flawed output.</p>\n<p>Across large enterprises, AI adoption is not limited by access to models or computing power, but constrained by process, policy, and trust.</p>\n<p>For other end-user companies, JPMorgan’s approach offers a useful reference point. AI is treated as part of the machinery that keeps the organisation running.</p>\n<p>That does not guarantee success. Returns may take years to appear, and some investments will not pay off. But the bank’s position is that the greater risk lies in doing too little, not too much.</p>\n<p>(Photo by IKECHUKWU JULIUS UGWU)</p>\n<p>See also: Banks operationalise as Plumery AI launches standardised integration</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

The transaction values Neysa at around $300 million, though the exact equity being acquired in the first phase was not disclosed.\n\n\n\nThe investment is expected to be among the largest fundraises by an AI company in India and marks a strategic move for Blackstone, which is increasingly bullish on data centres and AI-led infrastructure globally.

      "content": "Shunya Labs has announced the launch of Zero Codeswitch, a speech recognition foundation model designed to understand naturally code-mixed and multilingual Indian speech, a key limitation in existing voice-based AI systems.\n\n\n\nThe Gurugram-based voice AI company said the model is built to recognise how people in India actually speak, frequently blending Hindi, English and regional languages within the same sentence without relying on intermediate translation layers. The company says that Zero Codeswitch has achieved a 3.10% Word Error Rate (WER) on the OpenASR leaderboard, representing a 48% improvement over the next-best competing model, according to the company.\n\n\n\nShunya Labs said the model is designed to run efficiently on standard CPUs, reducing deployment costs by up to 20 times while maintaining sub-100 millisecond latency for real-time applications such as customer support, voice assistants and automated call centres.\n\n\n\n“Shunya Labs was built with a focus on deep research rather than short-term marketing narratives,” Ritu Mehrotra, CEO and co-founder of Shunya Labs said. “With Zero Codeswitch, we are building foundational technology for Indian languages that prioritises accuracy, latency and real-world usability. Our goal is not just to adopt AI, but to build it at the foundation level in India.”\n\n\n\nUnlike global speech models that are primarily trained on English data and later adapted for Indian languages, Shunya Labs said its foundation models are trained from the ground up on millions of hours of real-world Indian speech data. This includes variations in accent, dialect, pronunciation and slang across regions, allowing the system to better handle Hinglish and other code-mixed speech patterns.\n\n\n\n“‘Shunya’ represents our philosophy of starting from first principles,” Sourav Bandyopadhyay, CTO and co-founder of Shunya Labs said. “With Zero Codeswitch, we are creating an intelligence layer that truly listens, engineered for India’s linguistic diversity and optimised for real-world deployment,.”\n\n\n\nThe company said Zero Codeswitch is intended for enterprise and public-sector use cases where data privacy is critical. The model can be deployed on-premises or in air-gapped environments, allowing organisations to train domain-specific versions while retaining control over sensitive data. Shunya Labs said it complies with HIPAA, SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 standards and supports CPU-first deployments to reduce reliance on specialised GPU infrastructure.\nThe post Shunya Labs Unveils AI Model for India’s Code-Mixed Speech appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "title": "How Agentic AI is Redesigning Job Roles for Engineers",
      "content": "Across India’s enterprises, from IT services and consulting to manufacturing and education, AI has shifted the centre of gravity of work. According to an EY survey of over 200 Indian enterprise leaders assessing their experience with generative AI and agentic AI, organisations have clearly advanced in their AI journey, with nearly half now reporting multiple live use cases.\n\n\n\nAI adoption has clearly moved pilots. However, large-scale integration is still in early stages, with only 10% organisations reporting enterprise-wide deployment. This has also created new job roles like agentic engineers who can develop and deploy AI agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Agentic AI is fundamentally changing the nature of roles, not just automating tasks,” Anurag Malik, partner and India leader for People Consulting at EY India, tells AIM. “As AI systems begin to plan, decide, and act with greater autonomy, organisations will create new roles focused on AI orchestration, model oversight, risk and ethics, and domain-led decision making.”\n\n\n\nIn HR functions, for instance, AI agents are already screening candidates, mapping skills, predicting attrition, and simulating workforce scenarios. What is changing is who owns the outcome.\n\n\n\n“What will grow is the role of the human–AI workforce designer, responsible for redefining roles where humans and AI jointly own outcomes, and the AI talent intelligence lead, who will translate AI insights into workforce decisions leaders can stand behind,” Malik explains.\n\n\n\nThis shift marks a move away from narrow job descriptions toward fluid roles that combine human judgement with machine intelligence. People are no longer just users of AI systems—they are supervisors, interpreters, and ethical stewards.\n\n\n\nThe scale of this change is already visible. EY’s Work Reimagined research shows India leads in AI adoption, with 62% of employees already using AI regularly at work. But adoption alone is no longer enough.\n\n\n\nRAG Behind Agentic AI\n\n\n\nIn a Reddit post, a user who recently accepted the role of an AI agentic engineer expressed that he was apprehensive about what the new job would entail, as he has mostly been using RAG systems. RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, go beyond training data to combine LLMs with external data sources to provide more accurate answers.\n\n\n\nOther users commented that most AI agentic engineers work across RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, and real-world task integration. While the field is still emerging, they observed that engineers who can connect models to actual business or system logic are likely to be in high demand, making this a strong space for rapid growth.\n\n\n\nThey explained that the core of the job is wiring agents into real business logic while keeping them reliable. Day-to-day work typically includes defining tools with strict JSON schemas, setting timeouts and retries, maintaining evaluation suites and golden tests for each feature, and tracking latency, cost, and failure modes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt also involves shipping ETL pipelines to refresh RAG stores, adding safety filters, fallbacks, and human-in-the-loop workflows. In their experience, tools like LangGraph and Temporal are useful for orchestration and retries, Pinecone for retrieval, and DreamFactory for exposing CRUD APIs over legacy SQL with role-based access control so agents can perform real work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis evolution is already creating demand for new capabilities, not just technical skills, but cross-functional ones.\n\n\n\n“This is creating demand for new skills such as system supervision, prompt and workflow design, outcome validation, and cross-functional problem-solving,” says Nipun Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship. “The real change is not job loss, but job redesign.”\n\n\n\nOrganisations that recognise this early are moving faster to align their talent strategies with AI-led operating models. Delay risks creating a mismatch between what AI can do and what people are prepared to manage.\n\n\n\n“Organisations that proactively realign roles and build these capabilities will unlock higher productivity and resilience, while those that delay will struggle to integrate AI effectively into everyday work,” Sharma warns.\n\n\n\nThe idea that AI will eliminate jobs outright is increasingly being challenged by those closest to workforce transformation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Agentic AI is fundamentally rewiring the workforce by shifting work from execution to orchestration,” Sharma observes. “As autonomous systems begin to plan, act, and optimise workflows, human roles are evolving toward oversight, judgement, exception handling, and ethical decision-making.”\n\n\n\nBeyond the Tech Shift\n\n\n\nThe transformation is not limited to IT or digital-native sectors. Sangeeta Gupta, senior VP at Nasscom, says that agentic AI will completely change workforce roles across manufacturing, retail, education, and services in the next two to three years.\n\n\n\n“What began as rule-based systems has evolved into agentic AI systems that have the capability to act independently, understand context, make decisions, and continuously learn,” she notes. “We foresee agentic AI as a transformative force that will redefine, not replace, workforce roles across industries.”\n\n\n\nAs AI agents increasingly handle routine analysis, workflows, and follow-ups, humans will move up the value chain. The near-term impact, she emphasises, is not mass displacement but productivity gains driven by end-to-end process redesign.\n\n\n\n“Human accountability remains central, especially in safety-critical and regulated environments, making trust, auditability, and clear escalation frameworks essential,” Gupta remarks.\n\n\n\nThis reality is reflected in how enterprises are deploying agentic AI today. While experimentation is widespread, full autonomy is rare.\n\n\n\n“While 62% of global enterprises are experimenting with AI agents, 77% are deploying them with human-in-the-loop design,” Gupta adds, quoting a KPMG report. “Data governance is foundational, with 68% of enterprises strengthening data management to build scalable, reliable agentic solutions.”\n\n\n\nThe Upskilling Imperative\n\n\n\nAs roles change, so must skills. Across sectors, demand is growing for domain fluency, process thinking, data literacy, and the ability to supervise agent-driven systems.\n\n\n\n“As AI matures, specialised talent demand is expected to rise in areas like advanced AI research, data science, human–technology interface design, and domain-led innovation,” Gupta says.\n\n\n\nNasscom, she adds, is working with government bodies, regulators, and educational institutions to modernise curricula and scale AI literacy. “Industry today is leading by example—accelerating AI and hybrid cloud adoption through reskilling, co-creation, and ecosystem partnerships.”\n\n\n\nThe message is clear: agentic AI is not replacing human work, but acting as a catalyst to redefine it. The organisations that succeed will be those that redesign roles, invest in reskilling, and build governance frameworks that keep humans firmly in the loop.\n\n\n\nAs Gupta sums up, “Together, these frameworks support a smooth, human-centred transition where AI agents augment human capabilities without undermining safety, fairness, or societal values.”\nThe post How Agentic AI is Redesigning Job Roles for Engineers appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "title": "How Remote uses LangChain and LangGraph to onboard thousands of customers with AI",
      "content": "Guest post written by Jos&#xe9; Mussa (Staff Software Engineer @ Remote)Remote is a fast-growing startup helping companies hire, manage, and pay employees globally from a single platform. Remote&#x2019;s customers operate across many countries and regulatory environments, and they trust Remote as the system of record for their employee, payroll, and compliance data. Every new customer arrives with a unique set of HR and payroll data , with sometimes thousands of spreadsheets or large SQL exports. Migrating that data accurately and quickly is make-or-break for onboarding, but doing it manually simply doesn&#x2019;t scale.To solve this challenge, Remote built a Code Execution Agent inside its AI Service to automate these migrations. This agent brings together the reasoning power of large language models with the precision of deterministic code execution. Here&apos;s how it works, why Remote chose LangChain and LangGraph to build it, and what they learned along the way.The Challenge: Context windows and hallucinationsLLMs are powerful, but they have hard limits. Every model has a context window: the maximum number of tokens it can process at once. Even state&#x2011;of&#x2011;the&#x2011;art models like GPT&#x2011;5 cap out around 400k tokens, far less than the millions of characters in a large payroll spreadsheet. Models also need part of that window to track instructions, system prompts, and conversation history.Trying to feed a 50&#x202f;MB Excel file directly into an LLM isn&#x2019;t just expensive; it&#x2019;s likely to produce hallucinations. As Anthropic engineers have pointed out, when agents call tools directly, every intermediate result flows through the model, which can add tens of thousands of tokens per call and even exceed the context limit.For a global employment platform like Remote, where accuracy and compliance are non-negotiable, these constraints made it clear that a different approach to large-scale data migrations was necessary.The Solution: Let the models reason, let code executeRemote&#x2019;s Code Execution Agent separates the &#x201c;thinking&#x201d; from the &#x201c;doing.&#x201d; Instead of forcing the LLM to ingest all the data, it uses LangChain&#x2019;s tool&#x2011;calling interface to decide what steps to take, then writes and runs real Python code to transform the data.Anthropic&apos;s research on code execution shows why this hybrid design works: by letting agents run code in a sandbox, tool definitions and intermediate results stay outside the context window. Only instructions and summaries pass through the model, dramatically cutting token usage and virtually eliminating hallucination risk.Here&apos;s how Remote&#x2019;s agent works in practice:File ingestion. Customers upload their raw data (CSV, Excel or SQL exports) to Remote&#x2019;s secure storage.Agent reasoning. Using LangChain&#x2019;s tool&#x2011;calling, the agent receives a task like &#x201c;Convert this file into Remote&#x2019;s employee onboarding schema.&#x201d; It maps out how to translate the input columns into the schema.Sandboxed execution. Behind the scenes, a Python sandbox (running in WebAssembly) executes the LLM&#x2011;generated code. Remote leans on libraries like Pandas because they&apos;re fast and flexible for data analysis.Iterative refinement. The agent reviews the output, writes more code if needed, and repeats until the data meets the schema.Structured output. The final, validated JSON file is stored for ingestion.

      "content_html": "<p>Guest post written by José Mussa (Staff Software Engineer @ Remote)Remote is a fast-growing startup helping companies hire, manage, and pay employees globally from a single platform. Remote’s customers operate across many countries and regulatory environments, and they trust Remote as the system of record for their employee, payroll, and compliance data. Every new customer arrives with a unique set of HR and payroll data , with sometimes thousands of spreadsheets or large SQL exports. Migrating that data accurately and quickly is make-or-break for onboarding, but doing it manually simply doesn’t scale.To solve this challenge, Remote built a Code Execution Agent inside its AI Service to automate these migrations. This agent brings together the reasoning power of large language models with the precision of deterministic code execution. Here's how it works, why Remote chose LangChain and LangGraph to build it, and what they learned along the way.The Challenge: Context windows and hallucinationsLLMs are powerful, but they have hard limits. Every model has a context window: the maximum number of tokens it can process at once. Even state‑of‑the‑art models like GPT‑5 cap out around 400k tokens, far less than the millions of characters in a large payroll spreadsheet. Models also need part of that window to track instructions, system prompts, and conversation history.Trying to feed a 50 MB Excel file directly into an LLM isn’t just expensive; it’s likely to produce hallucinations. As Anthropic engineers have pointed out, when agents call tools directly, every intermediate result flows through the model, which can add tens of thousands of tokens per call and even exceed the context limit.For a global employment platform like Remote, where accuracy and compliance are non-negotiable, these constraints made it clear that a different approach to large-scale data migrations was necessary.The Solution: Let the models reason, let code executeRemote’s Code Execution Agent separates the “thinking” from the “doing.” Instead of forcing the LLM to ingest all the data, it uses LangChain’s tool‑calling interface to decide what steps to take, then writes and runs real Python code to transform the data.Anthropic's research on code execution shows why this hybrid design works: by letting agents run code in a sandbox, tool definitions and intermediate results stay outside the context window. Only instructions and summaries pass through the model, dramatically cutting token usage and virtually eliminating hallucination risk.Here's how Remote’s agent works in practice:File ingestion. Customers upload their raw data (CSV, Excel or SQL exports) to Remote’s secure storage.Agent reasoning. Using LangChain’s tool‑calling, the agent receives a task like “Convert this file into Remote’s employee onboarding schema.” It maps out how to translate the input columns into the schema.Sandboxed execution. Behind the scenes, a Python sandbox (running in WebAssembly) executes the LLM‑generated code. Remote leans on libraries like Pandas because they're fast and flexible for data analysis.Iterative refinement. The agent reviews the output, writes more code if needed, and repeats until the data meets the schema.Structured output. The final, validated JSON file is stored for ingestion. Large intermediate results never pass back to the model, keeping the context small.This architecture started as a proof of concept where Remote fed a 5,000-row Excel file into the agent. The agent loaded the file in the sandbox, mapped each entry to the schema using Pandas, and could answer queries like \"What is the age of employee X?\" by running code instead of generating text. Remote also limits console output so the model doesn't try to read entire datasets – a simple \"show the first N rows\" pattern borrowed straight from data science notebooks.Why LangChain and LangGraphRemote chose LangChain because its ecosystem offers mature abstractions for prompt handling and tool invocation.
