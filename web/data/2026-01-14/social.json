More on this later - but wanted to highlight that it's able to go completely wild!\n\n4/ Subagent for calendar scheduling: LLMs suck at working with calendars! So i have a subagent specifically for finding my availability - its works a lot better\n\n5/ Agent inbox to review: as mentioned, some actions require human approval. LangSmith Agent Builder ships with an agent inbox to review and approve the actions the agent wants to take\n\n6/ message_user to ask questions: sometimes my agent doesn't know what it should do.

It starts by deep-researching marketing insights</p>\n<p>2. It turns that into an execution plan</p>\n<p>3. It builds both frontend and backend</p>\n<p>4. It helps with deployment, SEO, growth, and analytics</p>\n<p>More importantly, it specializes in the core components you need to build and sell software online:</p>\n<p>• Authentication flows</p>\n<p>• Stripe payments</p>\n<p>• Infrastructure</p>\n<p>Their goal here is not to be another autocomplete tool or a copilot to help you write software.</p>\n<p>Their goal is to become a \"vibe business team\" that helps you build a business from the ground up.</p>\n<p>Here is a link for you to check them out: https://t.co/MZjyLiUmc1</p>\n<p>Thanks to the team for helping me onboard on the platform and collaborating with me on the post.</p>"
