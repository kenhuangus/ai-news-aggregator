      "title": "Why Apple chose Google over OpenAI: What enterprise AI buyers can learn from the Gemini deal",
      "content": "Apple&#8217;s multi-year agreement to integrate Google&#8217;s Gemini models into its revamped Siri offers a rare window into how one of the world&#8217;s most selective technology companies evaluates foundation models – and the criteria should matter to any enterprise weighing similar decisions.\nThe stakes were considerable. Apple had been publicly integrating ChatGPT into its devices since late 2024, giving OpenAI prominent positioning in the Apple Intelligence ecosystem.\nGoogle&#8217;s Gemini win represents a shift in Apple&#8217;s AI infrastructure strategy, one that relegates OpenAI to what Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research, describes as &#8220;a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer.&#8221;\nThe evaluation that mattered\nApple&#8217;s reasoning was notably specific. &#8220;After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google&#8217;s AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,&#8221; according to the joint statement. The phrasing matters – Apple didn&#8217;t cite partnership convenience, pricing, or ecosystem compatibility. The company framed this explicitly as a capabilities assessment.\nApple&#8217;s evaluation criteria likely mirrored concerns familiar to any organisation building AI into core products: model performance at scale, inference latency, multimodal capabilities, and crucially, the ability to run models both on-device and in cloud environments while maintaining privacy standards.\nGoogle&#8217;s technology already powers Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy AI in millions of devices, providing proven deployment evidence at consumer scale. But Apple&#8217;s decision unlocks something different: integration in more than two billion active devices, with the technical demands that come with Apple&#8217;s performance and privacy requirements.\nWhat has changed since ChatGPT integration\nThe timing raises questions. Apple rolled out ChatGPT integration just over a year ago, positioning Siri to tap into the chatbot for complex queries. The company now states, &#8220;there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time,&#8221; but the competitive dynamics have clearly shifted.\nOpenAI&#8217;s response to Google&#8217;s Gemini 3 release in late 2025 – what reports described as a &#8220;code red&#8221; to accelerate development – suggests the competitive pressure was real. For enterprises, this highlights a risk often under-weighted in vendor selection: the pace of model capability advancement varies significantly between providers, and today&#8217;s leader may not maintain that position in a multi-year deployment.\nApple&#8217;s choice of a multi-year agreement with Google, rather than maintaining flexibility to switch between providers, suggests confidence in Google&#8217;s development trajectory. That&#8217;s a bet on sustained R&amp;D investment, continued model improvements, and infrastructure scaling – the same factors enterprise buyers need to assess beyond current benchmarks.\nThe infrastructure question\nThe deal raises immediate concerns about concentration. &#8220;The seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that they also have Android and Chrome,&#8221; Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on social media. The critique reflects a legitimate enterprise concern about vendor dependency.\nGoogle now powers AI features in both major mobile operating systems through different mechanisms: directly via Android, and through this partnership for iOS. For enterprises deploying AI capabilities, the parallel is that relying on a single foundation model provider creates technical and commercial dependencies that extend beyond the immediate integration.\nThis makes Apple&#8217;s architectural approach worth examining. The company emphasised that &#8220;Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple&#8217;s industry-leading privacy standards.&#8221;\nThe hybrid deployment model – on-device processing for privacy-sensitive operations, cloud-based models for complex tasks – offers a template for enterprises balancing capability with data governance requirements.\nMarket implications beyond mobile\nThe deal&#8217;s immediate impact was measurable: Alphabet&#8217;s market valuation crossed US$4 trillion on Monday, with the stock having jumped 65% in 2024 on growing investor confidence in its AI efforts. But the strategic implications extend beyond market caps.\nGoogle has been methodically building positions in the AI stack – frontier models, image and video generation, and now default integration into iOS devices. For enterprises, this vertical integration matters when evaluating cloud AI services: a provider&#8217;s foundation model capabilities increasingly connect to their broader infrastructure, tools, and ecosystem positioning.\nApple&#8217;s setbacks on the AI front – delayed Siri upgrades, executive changes, lukewarm reception for initial generative AI tools – are instructive from another angle. Even companies with enormous resources and talent can struggle with AI product execution. The decision to partner with Google rather than persist with entirely proprietary development acknowledges the complexity and resource demands of frontier model development.\nThe search revenue connection\nThe Gemini deal builds on an existing commercial relationship that generates tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple: Google pays to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. That arrangement has faced regulatory scrutiny, but it establishes precedent for deep technical integration between the companies.\nThe search deal likely influenced negotiations around the Gemini integration, just as existing vendor relationships shape enterprise AI procurement. Those relationships can be advantages – established trust, proven integration capabilities – or constraints that limit evaluation of alternatives.\nThe OpenAI question\nThe deal leaves OpenAI in an awkward position. ChatGPT remains available on Apple devices, but as an optional feature rather than the infrastructure layer. For a company that has positioned itself as the AI leader, losing default integration to Google represents a strategic setback.\nThe competitive dynamic offers a reminder that the foundation model market remains fluid. Provider positioning can shift quickly, and exclusive relationships between major players can reshape options for everyone else. Maintaining options – through abstraction layers, multi-model strategies, or portable architectures – becomes more valuable in rapidly evolving markets.\nWhat comes next\nGoogle stated that Gemini models will power not just the revamped Siri coming later this year, but &#8220;other future Apple Intelligence features.&#8221; The scope of integration will likely expand as Apple builds out its AI capabilities, creating deeper technical dependencies and raising the stakes of the partnership.\nThe financial terms remain undisclosed, leaving the question of how Apple and Google structure pricing for this scale of deployment? Enterprise buyers negotiating foundation model licensing will be watching for any signals about how such deals get priced at a massive scale.\nApple&#8217;s decision doesn&#8217;t make Google&#8217;s Gemini the obvious choice for every enterprise – far from it. But the deal does offer validated evidence of what one extremely selective technology company prioritised when evaluating foundation models under demanding requirements. For enterprise AI buyers navigating their own evaluations, that&#8217;s a signal worth considering amid the noise of vendor marketing and benchmark leader boards.\nSee also: Apple plans big Siri update with help from Google AI\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Those relationships can be advantages – established trust, proven integration capabilities – or constraints that limit evaluation of alternatives.</p>\n<p>The OpenAI question</p>\n<p>The deal leaves OpenAI in an awkward position. ChatGPT remains available on Apple devices, but as an optional feature rather than the infrastructure layer. For a company that has positioned itself as the AI leader, losing default integration to Google represents a strategic setback.</p>\n<p>The competitive dynamic offers a reminder that the foundation model market remains fluid. Provider positioning can shift quickly, and exclusive relationships between major players can reshape options for everyone else. Maintaining options – through abstraction layers, multi-model strategies, or portable architectures – becomes more valuable in rapidly evolving markets.</p>\n<p>What comes next</p>\n<p>Google stated that Gemini models will power not just the revamped Siri coming later this year, but &#8220;other future Apple Intelligence features.&#8221; The scope of integration will likely expand as Apple builds out its AI capabilities, creating deeper technical dependencies and raising the stakes of the partnership.</p>\n<p>The financial terms remain undisclosed, leaving the question of how Apple and Google structure pricing for this scale of deployment? Enterprise buyers negotiating foundation model licensing will be watching for any signals about how such deals get priced at a massive scale.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s decision doesn&#8217;t make Google&#8217;s Gemini the obvious choice for every enterprise – far from it. But the deal does offer validated evidence of what one extremely selective technology company prioritised when evaluating foundation models under demanding requirements. For enterprise AI buyers navigating their own evaluations, that&#8217;s a signal worth considering amid the noise of vendor marketing and benchmark leader boards.</p>\n<p>See also: Apple plans big Siri update with help from Google AI</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "content": "Anthropic has released Cowork, a new feature that runs agentic workflows on local files for non coding tasks currently available in research preview inside the Claude macOS desktop app. \n\n\n\nWhat Cowork Does At The File System Level\n\n\n\nCowork currently runs as a dedicated mode in the Claude desktop app. When you start a Cowork session, you choose a folder on your system. Claude can then read, edit, or create files only inside that folder. \n\n\n\nAnthropic gives concrete examples. Claude can reorganize a downloads folder by sorting and renaming files. It can read a directory of screenshots, extract amounts, and build an expense spreadsheet. It can traverse scattered notes in that folder and produce a structured report draft.\n\n\n\nThe interface keeps the interaction in the standard chat surface. You describe the task in natural language. Claude constructs an internal plan, executes file operations, and streams status messages as it progresses. You can continue to send follow up instructions while the work is running. \n\n\n\nRelationship To Claude Code And Claude Agent SDK\n\n\n\nCowork is not a separate model. Anthropic states that Cowork is built on the same foundations as Claude Code and that it uses the Claude Agent SDK as the underlying agent stack.\n\n\n\nClaude Code started as a command line oriented environment that allowed developers to run shell commands and mutate project files using natural language, with later web and Slack interfaces on top. Many Max users pushed Claude Code into non coding workflows, using it as a general purpose agent that operates on arbitrary directories and tools. That usage pattern directly informed Cowork. \n\n\n\nTechCrunch describes Cowork as a more accessible version of Claude Code, implemented as a sandboxed instance of the same agent stack. Users still designate a specific folder, but there is no need to work in a terminal or configure virtual environments. \n\n\n\nConnectors, Skills, And Browser Based Workflows\n\n\n\nCowork can extend beyond local storage. Anthropic allows Cowork to reuse existing Claude connectors, which integrate external services such as Asana, Notion, and PayPal. Cowork also supports an initial set of Skills that are optimized for constructing documents, presentations, and similar artifacts. These Skills package instructions and resources for specific job functions.\n\n\n\nWhen Cowork is paired with Claude in Chrome, the same agent plan can include browser steps. Anthropic and The Verge articles both highlight browser related tasks where Claude can follow links, read pages, and act inside web apps under user supervision. \n\n\n\nThis combination gives Cowork a three layer tool surface:\n\n\n\n\nLocal file system access restricted to the chosen folder.\n\n\n\nConnectors for structured external systems.\n\n\n\nBrowser actions through Claude in Chrome. \n\n\n\n\nFrom an implementation perspective, this is a standard agent tool configuration on top of the Claude Agent SDK. The difference is that Cowork hides the tool graph and exposes only a conversational task interface.\n\n\n\nAgentic Behavior, Planning, And Parallel Tasks\n\n\n\nAnthropic stresses that Cowork runs with more agency than a regular Claude conversation. Once you specify a task, Claude builds a plan, executes a series of tool calls and file operations, and keeps you updated about intermediate steps.\n\n\n\nYou do not need to paste context repeatedly or manually convert outputs. Cowork reuses the folder as a persistent context boundary. It writes intermediate artifacts directly into that directory, then consumes those artifacts in subsequent steps.\n\n\n\nSafety Model, Access Control, And Prompt Injection\n\n\n\nBecause Cowork operates on real files, safety constraints are explicit in the product design. Anthropic states that users choose which folders and connectors Claude can see. Claude cannot read or edit content outside those structures.\n\n\n\nCowork always asks for confirmation before it takes significant actions. Ofcourse, with all the benefits, there are some heads-up: It is recommended to give precise instructions and warns that misinterpretation is possible. \n\n\n\nAnthropic also calls out prompt injection as a primary risk. If Claude processes untrusted content on the internet or in local documents, that content can attempt to alter the plan and steer behavior away from user intent. Anthropic says it has deployed defenses, but it describes agent safety, defined as securing real world actions, as an ongoing research problem.\n\n\n\nAvailability\n\n\n\nCowork is available today as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. The Max plan is priced between $100 and $200 dollars per month depending on usage. Users on other plans can join a waitlist. Anthropic plans to add cross device sync and Windows support in future iterations.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nLocal folder scoped agent: Cowork runs inside the Claude macOS app as an agent that can read, edit, and create files only inside user selected folders, giving Claude direct file system access with explicit scoping.\n\n\n\nSame stack as Claude Code, different surface: Cowork is built on the same Claude Agent SDK foundations as Claude Code, but targets non coding workflows through a GUI instead of a terminal based developer interface.\n\n\n\nTools: files, connectors, browser: Cowork combines three tool layers in one plan, local file operations, Claude connectors for services like Notion or Asana, and browser actions via Claude in Chrome.\n\n\n\nAgentic, multi step execution: Once given a task, Cowork plans and executes multi step workflows, streams progress updates, and can queue multiple tasks in parallel, rather than operating as a single prompt response loop.\n\n\n\nConstrained but destructive capable: Access is limited to chosen folders and configured connectors, and Cowork asks before major actions, but it can still perform destructive operations such as file deletions, so it must be treated like a powerful automation tool, not a harmless chat bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Technical details here. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "title": "Google AI Releases Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP): An Open-Source Standard Designed to Power the Next Generation of Agentic Commerce",
      "content": "Can AI shopping agents move beyond sending product links and actually complete trusted purchases end to end inside a chat? Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP, is Google’s new open standard for agentic commerce. It gives AI agents and merchant systems a shared language so that a shopping query can move from product discovery to an authenticated order without custom integrations for every retailer and every surface.\n\n\n\nhttps://developers.googleblog.com/under-the-hood-universal-commerce-protocol-ucp/\n\n\nWhat problem is UCP solving?\n\n\n\nToday, most AI shopping experiences stop at recommendation. The agent aggregates links, you handle stock checks, coupon codes, and checkout flows on separate sites. Google’s engineering team describes this as an N by N integration bottleneck. Each new conversational surface requires separate work from every merchant and payment provider.\n\n\n\nUCP collapses that to one abstraction. Platforms such as Gemini or AI Mode in Search integrate once with the protocol. Businesses expose their commerce behavior once behind UCP. Payment Service Providers and Credential Providers integrate at the payment layer. The same protocol can support many verticals such as shopping, travel, or services.\n\n\n\nRoles and core building blocks\n\n\n\nThe UCP core concepts document defines four primary actors:\n\n\n\n\nPlatform, which is the agent or application that orchestrates the user journey. Examples include AI shopping assistants and search surfaces.\n\n\n\nBusiness, which is the merchant or service provider and the Merchant of Record.\n\n\n\nCredential Provider, which manages payment instruments and personal data such as addresses.\n\n\n\nPayment Service Provider, which processes authorizations, captures, and settlements.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of these roles, UCP introduces three fundamental constructs:\n\n\n\n\nCapabilities, such as Checkout, Identity Linking, and Order.\n\n\n\nExtensions, such as Discounts, Fulfillment, or AP2 Mandates, which extend a capability via an extends field.\n\n\n\nServices, which bind capabilities to transports such as REST API, Model Context Protocol, and Agent2Agent.\n\n\n\n\nThe GitHub repo lists four initial key capabilities for shopping:\n\n\n\n\nCheckout manages checkout sessions, cart contents, totals, and tax.\n\n\n\nIdentity Linking uses OAuth 2.0 so agents can act on behalf of users.\n\n\n\nOrder emits lifecycle events for shipment, returns, and refunds.\n\n\n\nPayment Token Exchange coordinates token and credential exchange between Payment Service Providers and Credential Providers.\n\n\n\n\nCommerce lifecycle for an AI agent\n\n\n\nThe Google reference implementation and the samples repository use a simple store to illustrate the UCP flow.\n\n\n\nA typical agentic checkout looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe agent fetches the business profile from /.well-known/ucp, discovers that dev.ucp.shopping.checkout and associated extensions are available, and resolves schemas for those capabilities.\n\n\n\nIf the user has linked an account, the agent performs Identity Linking with OAuth 2.0 scopes that permit checkout and order read operations for that merchant.\n\n\n\nThe agent calls the Checkout capability using the REST or MCP binding, passing line items, buyer region, and any required context. The server returns a checkout object with line items, totals, and candidate fulfillment options.\n\n\n\nThe agent applies discounts or loyalty benefits by invoking extensions that modify the composed checkout schema, then asks the user to confirm the final order.\n\n\n\nPayment is routed through a payment handler that understands a specific payment instrument schema, such as a tokenized card. Once the Payment Service Provider authorizes the transaction, the business creates an order.\n\n\n\nThe Order capability emits webhook events for shipment and post purchase adjustments, which the agent can present in the conversation.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the user perspective, this keeps the entire flow in a single conversation with clear consent steps.\n\n\n\nTransports, payments, and security\n\n\n\nThe specification defines a transport layer with bindings for REST, Model Context Protocol, Agent2Agent, and an Embedded Protocol that allows deeply customized merchant checkout experiences while still using UCP data structures.\n\n\n\nFor payments, UCP integrates with Agent Payments Protocol. The payment architecture separates payment instruments from payment handlers, and uses mandates scoped to a specific checkout hash. This design supports binding proof and reduces token replay risk, which is important when agents execute payments without the user directly in the browser.\n\n\n\nCredential Providers issue tokens and hold sensitive card data or addresses. Payment Service Providers consume those tokens and talk to card networks.

      "content_html": "<p>Can AI shopping agents move beyond sending product links and actually complete trusted purchases end to end inside a chat? Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP, is Google’s new open standard for agentic commerce. It gives AI agents and merchant systems a shared language so that a shopping query can move from product discovery to an authenticated order without custom integrations for every retailer and every surface.</p>\n<p>https://developers.googleblog.com/under-the-hood-universal-commerce-protocol-ucp/</p>\n<p>What problem is UCP solving?</p>\n<p>Today, most AI shopping experiences stop at recommendation. The agent aggregates links, you handle stock checks, coupon codes, and checkout flows on separate sites. Google’s engineering team describes this as an N by N integration bottleneck. Each new conversational surface requires separate work from every merchant and payment provider.</p>\n<p>UCP collapses that to one abstraction. Platforms such as Gemini or AI Mode in Search integrate once with the protocol. Businesses expose their commerce behavior once behind UCP. Payment Service Providers and Credential Providers integrate at the payment layer. The same protocol can support many verticals such as shopping, travel, or services.</p>\n<p>Roles and core building blocks</p>\n<p>The UCP core concepts document defines four primary actors:</p>\n<p>Platform, which is the agent or application that orchestrates the user journey. Examples include AI shopping assistants and search surfaces.</p>\n<p>Business, which is the merchant or service provider and the Merchant of Record.</p>\n<p>Credential Provider, which manages payment instruments and personal data such as addresses.</p>\n<p>Payment Service Provider, which processes authorizations, captures, and settlements.</p>\n<p>On top of these roles, UCP introduces three fundamental constructs:</p>\n<p>Capabilities, such as Checkout, Identity Linking, and Order.</p>\n<p>Extensions, such as Discounts, Fulfillment, or AP2 Mandates, which extend a capability via an extends field.</p>\n<p>Services, which bind capabilities to transports such as REST API, Model Context Protocol, and Agent2Agent.</p>\n<p>The GitHub repo lists four initial key capabilities for shopping:</p>\n<p>Checkout manages checkout sessions, cart contents, totals, and tax.</p>\n<p>Identity Linking uses OAuth 2.0 so agents can act on behalf of users.</p>\n<p>Order emits lifecycle events for shipment, returns, and refunds.</p>\n<p>Payment Token Exchange coordinates token and credential exchange between Payment Service Providers and Credential Providers.</p>\n<p>Commerce lifecycle for an AI agent</p>\n<p>The Google reference implementation and the samples repository use a simple store to illustrate the UCP flow.</p>\n<p>A typical agentic checkout looks like this:</p>\n<p>The agent fetches the business profile from /.well-known/ucp, discovers that dev.ucp.shopping.checkout and associated extensions are available, and resolves schemas for those capabilities.</p>\n<p>If the user has linked an account, the agent performs Identity Linking with OAuth 2.0 scopes that permit checkout and order read operations for that merchant.</p>\n<p>The agent calls the Checkout capability using the REST or MCP binding, passing line items, buyer region, and any required context. The server returns a checkout object with line items, totals, and candidate fulfillment options.</p>\n<p>The agent applies discounts or loyalty benefits by invoking extensions that modify the composed checkout schema, then asks the user to confirm the final order.</p>\n<p>Payment is routed through a payment handler that understands a specific payment instrument schema, such as a tokenized card. Once the Payment Service Provider authorizes the transaction, the business creates an order.</p>\n<p>The Order capability emits webhook events for shipment and post purchase adjustments, which the agent can present in the conversation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, this keeps the entire flow in a single conversation with clear consent steps.</p>\n<p>Transports, payments, and security</p>\n<p>The specification defines a transport layer with bindings for REST, Model Context Protocol, Agent2Agent, and an Embedded Protocol that allows deeply customized merchant checkout experiences while still using UCP data structures.</p>\n<p>For payments, UCP integrates with Agent Payments Protocol. The payment architecture separates payment instruments from payment handlers, and uses mandates scoped to a specific checkout hash. This design supports binding proof and reduces token replay risk, which is important when agents execute payments without the user directly in the browser.</p>\n<p>Credential Providers issue tokens and hold sensitive card data or addresses. Payment Service Providers consume those tokens and talk to card networks. UCP keeps these roles explicit and uses verifiable credentials and signatures so that both agents and businesses have cryptographic evidence of what was authorized.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>UCP is an open standard and open source specification from Google that defines a common commerce language for AI agents, businesses, payment providers, and credential providers across the full shopping journey.</p>\n<p>The protocol is co developed with partners such as Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, and is already endorsed by more than 20 ecosystem players including Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, PayPal, Best Buy, The Home Depot, Macy’s, and Zalando.</p>\n<p>UCP models commerce through discoverable capabilities like Checkout, Identity Linking, and Order, plus extensible modules for discounts, fulfillment, and subscriptions, with merchants and agents negotiating a shared capability set dynamically via profiles hosted at .well-known/ucp.</p>\n<p>The protocol is transport agnostic, it supports REST, JSON RPC, Model Context Protocol, and Agent2Agent so the same capability schemas can be reused across backend services, MCP tool calls into LLM agents, and agent to agent networks without rewriting business logic.</p>\n<p>Payments in UCP integrate with Agent Payments Protocol and a modular payment handler design, which separates payment instruments from handlers and uses cryptographically provable mandates, so agents can execute checkout flows autonomously while preserving clear proof of user consent.</p>\n<p>Check out the GitHub Repo and Technical details. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "title": "Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI",
      "content": "Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company&#x27;s workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce&#x27;s most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging &quot;agentic AI&quot; movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.&quot;Slackbot isn&#x27;t just another copilot or AI assistant,&quot; said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack&#x27;s chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. &quot;It&#x27;s the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce.&quot;From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground upHarris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: &quot;The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche.&quot;The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack&#x27;s early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.&quot;It&#x27;s two different things,&quot; Harris explained. &quot;The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it&#x27;s based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data.&quot;Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. &quot;People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward,&quot; Harris said.Why Anthropic&#x27;s Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come nextThe new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic&#x27;s large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack&#x27;s commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was &quot;the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM&quot; when Slack began building the new system.But that exclusivity won&#x27;t last. &quot;We are, this year, going to support additional providers,&quot; Harris said. &quot;We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we&#x27;re going to use Gemini for some things.&quot; He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff&#x27;s view that large language models are becoming commoditized: &quot;You&#x27;ve heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they&#x27;re democratized. I call them CPUs.&quot;On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. &quot;Models don&#x27;t have any sort of security,&quot; he explained. &quot;If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don&#x27;t want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn&#x27;t.&quot;Inside Salesforce&#x27;s internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking resultsSalesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack&#x27;s chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: &quot;It&#x27;s the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history.&quot;Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.The adoption happened largely organically. &quot;I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called &#x27;The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,&#x27;&quot; Gavin said. &quot;People just started adding to it organically. I think it&#x27;s up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now.&quot;Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. &quot;Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks,&quot; she said.How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insightsDuring a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack&#x27;s product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.&quot;This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me,&quot; Bauer explained. &quot;What it&#x27;s doing is not just simply reading the image — it&#x27;s actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me.&quot;Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called &quot;a really great justification and plan to move forward.&quot; Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack&#x27;s collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.&quot;Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team.&quot;Rob Seaman, Slack&#x27;s chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: &quot;This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we&#x27;re going with Slackbot — we&#x27;re eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls.&quot;MrBeast&#x27;s company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they&#x27;re saving 90 minutes a dayAmong Salesforce&#x27;s pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company&#x27;s chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.&quot;As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest,&quot; Madrigal said. &quot;The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review.&quot;Madrigal said his security team signed off &quot;rather quickly&quot; — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. &quot;Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they&#x27;re part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly.&quot;One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving &quot;at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day.&quot; Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as &quot;an assistant who&#x27;s paying attention when I&#x27;m not.&quot;Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot &quot;an absolute &#x27;chaos tamer&#x27; for our team,&quot; estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily &quot;just by eliminating context switching.&quot;Slackbot vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Google Gemini: The fight for enterprise AI dominanceThe launch puts Salesforce in direct competition with Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot, which is integrated into Teams and the broader Microsoft 365 suite, as well as Google&#x27;s Gemini integrations across Workspace. When asked what distinguishes Slackbot from these alternatives, Seaman pointed to context and convenience.&quot;The thing that makes it most powerful for our customers and users is the proximity — it&#x27;s just right there in your Slack,&quot; Seaman said. &quot;There&#x27;s a tremendous convenience affordance that&#x27;s naturally built into it.&quot;The deeper advantage, executives argue, is that Slackbot already understands users&#x27; work without requiring setup or training. &quot;Most AI tools sound the same no matter who is using them,&quot; the company&#x27;s announcement stated. &quot;They lack context, miss nuance, and force you to jump between tools to get anything done.&quot;Harris put it more directly: &quot;If you&#x27;ve ever had that magic experience with AI — I think ChatGPT is a great example, it&#x27;s a great experience from a consumer perspective — Slackbot is really what we&#x27;re doing in the enterprise, to be this employee super agent that is loved, just like people love using Slack.&quot;Amy Bauer emphasized the frictionless nature of the experience. &quot;Slackbot is inherently grounded in the context, in the data that you have in Slack,&quot; she said. &quot;So as you continue working in Slack, Slackbot gets better because it&#x27;s grounded in the work that you&#x27;re doing there. There is no setup. There is no configuration for those end users.&quot;Salesforce&#x27;s ambitious plan to make Slackbot the one &#x27;super agent&#x27; that controls all the othersSalesforce positions Slackbot as what Harris calls a &quot;super agent&quot; — a central hub that can eventually coordinate with other AI agents across an organization.&quot;Every corporation is going to have an employee super agent,&quot; Harris said. &quot;Slackbot is essentially taking the magic of what Slack does. We think that Slackbot, and we&#x27;re really excited about it, is going to be that.&quot;The vision extends to third-party agents already launching in Slack. Last month, Anthropic released a preview of Claude Code for Slack, allowing developers to interact with Claude&#x27;s coding capabilities directly in chat threads. OpenAI, Google, Vercel, and others have also built agents for the platform.&quot;Most of the net-new apps that are being deployed to Slack are agents,&quot; Seaman noted during the press conference. &quot;This is proof of the promise of humans and agents coexisting and working together in Slack to solve problems.&quot;Harris described a future where Slackbot becomes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client, able to leverage tools from across the software ecosystem — similar to how the developer tool Cursor works. &quot;Slack can be an MCP client, and Slackbot will be the hub of that, leveraging all these tools out in the world, some of which will be these amazing agents,&quot; he said.But Harris also cautioned against over-promising on multi-agent coordination. &quot;I still think we&#x27;re in the single agent world,&quot; he said. &quot;FY26 is going to be the year where we started to see more coordination. But we&#x27;re going to do it with customer success in mind, and not demonstrate and talk about, like, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got 1,000 agents working together,&#x27; because I think that&#x27;s unrealistic.&quot;Slackbot costs nothing extra, but Salesforce&#x27;s data access fees could squeeze some customersSlackbot is included at no additional cost for customers on Business+ and Enterprise+ plans. &quot;There&#x27;s no additional fees customers have to do,&quot; Gavin confirmed. &quot;If they&#x27;re on one of those plans, they&#x27;re going to get Slackbot.&quot;However, some enterprise customers may face other cost pressures related to Salesforce&#x27;s broader data strategy. CIOs may see price increases for third-party applications that work with Salesforce data, as effects of higher charges for API access ripple through the software supply chain.Fivetran CEO George Fraser has warned that Salesforce&#x27;s shift in pricing policy for API access could have tangible consequences for enterprises relying on Salesforce as a system of record. &quot;They might not be able to use Fivetran to replicate their data to Snowflake and instead have to use Salesforce Data Cloud. Or they might find that they are not able to interact with their data via ChatGPT, and instead have to use Agentforce,&quot; Fraser said in a recent CIO report.Salesforce has framed the pricing change as standard industry practice.What Slackbot can do today, what&#x27;s coming in weeks, and what&#x27;s still on the roadmapThe new Slackbot begins rolling out today and will reach all eligible customers by the end of February. Mobile availability will complete by March 3, Bauer confirmed during her interview with VentureBeat.Some capabilities remain works in progress. Calendar reading and availability checking are available at launch, but the ability to actually book meetings is &quot;coming a few weeks after,&quot; according to Seaman. Image generation is not currently supported, though Bauer said it&#x27;s &quot;something that we are looking at in the future.&quot;When asked about integration with competing CRM systems like HubSpot and Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce representatives declined to provide specifics during the interview, though they acknowledged the question touched on key competitive differentiators.Salesforce is betting the future of work looks like a chat window—and it&#x27;s not aloneThe Slackbot launch is Salesforce&#x27;s bet that the future of enterprise work is conversational — that employees will increasingly prefer to interact with AI through natural language rather than navigating traditional software interfaces.Harris described Slack&#x27;s product philosophy using principles like &quot;don&#x27;t make me think&quot; and &quot;be a great host.&quot; The goal, he said, is for Slackbot to surface information proactively rather than requiring users to hunt for it.&quot;One of the revelations for me is LLMs applied to unstructured information are incredible,&quot; Harris said. &quot;And the amount of value you have if you&#x27;re a Slack user, if your corporation uses Slack — the amount of value in Slack is unbelievable. Because you&#x27;re talking about work, you&#x27;re sharing documents, you&#x27;re making decisions, but you can&#x27;t as a human go through that and really get the same value that an LLM can do.&quot;Looking ahead, Harris expects the interfaces themselves to evolve beyond pure conversation. &quot;We&#x27;re kind of saturating what we can do with purely conversational UIs,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we&#x27;ll start to see agents building an interface that best suits your intent, as opposed to trying to surface something within a conversational interface that matches your intent.&quot;Microsoft, Google, and a growing roster of AI startups are placing similar bets — that the winning enterprise AI will be the one embedded in the tools workers already use, not another application to learn. The race to become that invisible layer of workplace intelligence is now fully underway.For Salesforce, the stakes extend beyond a single product launch. After a bruising year on Wall Street and persistent questions about whether AI threatens its core business, the company is wagering that Slackbot can prove the opposite — that the tens of millions of people already chatting in Slack every day is not a vulnerability, but an unassailable advantage.Haley Gault, the Salesforce account executive in Pittsburgh who stumbled upon the new Slackbot on a snowy morning, captured the shift in a single sentence: &quot;I honestly can&#x27;t imagine working for another company not having access to these types of tools. This is just how I work now.&quot;That&#x27;s precisely what Salesforce is counting on.",

      "content_html": "<p>Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company&#x27;s workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce&#x27;s most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging &quot;agentic AI&quot; movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.&quot;Slackbot isn&#x27;t just another copilot or AI assistant,&quot; said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack&#x27;s chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. &quot;It&#x27;s the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce.&quot;From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground upHarris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: &quot;The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche.&quot;The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack&#x27;s early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.&quot;It&#x27;s two different things,&quot; Harris explained. &quot;The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it&#x27;s based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data.&quot;Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. &quot;People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward,&quot; Harris said.Why Anthropic&#x27;s Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come nextThe new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic&#x27;s large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack&#x27;s commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was &quot;the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM&quot; when Slack began building the new system.But that exclusivity won&#x27;t last. &quot;We are, this year, going to support additional providers,&quot; Harris said. &quot;We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we&#x27;re going to use Gemini for some things.&quot; He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff&#x27;s view that large language models are becoming commoditized: &quot;You&#x27;ve heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they&#x27;re democratized. I call them CPUs.&quot;On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. &quot;Models don&#x27;t have any sort of security,&quot; he explained. &quot;If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don&#x27;t want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn&#x27;t.&quot;Inside Salesforce&#x27;s internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking resultsSalesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack&#x27;s chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: &quot;It&#x27;s the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history.&quot;Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.The adoption happened largely organically. &quot;I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called &#x27;The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,&#x27;&quot; Gavin said. &quot;People just started adding to it organically. I think it&#x27;s up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now.&quot;Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. &quot;Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks,&quot; she said.How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insightsDuring a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack&#x27;s product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.&quot;This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me,&quot; Bauer explained. &quot;What it&#x27;s doing is not just simply reading the image — it&#x27;s actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me.&quot;Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called &quot;a really great justification and plan to move forward.&quot; Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack&#x27;s collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.&quot;Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team.&quot;Rob Seaman, Slack&#x27;s chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: &quot;This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we&#x27;re going with Slackbot — we&#x27;re eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls.&quot;MrBeast&#x27;s company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they&#x27;re saving 90 minutes a dayAmong Salesforce&#x27;s pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company&#x27;s chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.&quot;As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest,&quot; Madrigal said. &quot;The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review.&quot;Madrigal said his security team signed off &quot;rather quickly&quot; — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. &quot;Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they&#x27;re part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly.&quot;One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving &quot;at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day.&quot; Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as &quot;an assistant who&#x27;s paying attention when I&#x27;m not.&quot;Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot &quot;an absolute &#x27;chaos tamer&#x27; for our team,&quot; estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily &quot;just by eliminating context switching.&quot;Slackbot vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Google Gemini: The fight for enterprise AI dominanceThe launch puts Salesforce in direct competition with Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot, which is integrated into Teams and the broader Microsoft 365 suite, as well as Google&#x27;s Gemini integrations across Workspace. When asked what distinguishes Slackbot from these alternatives, Seaman pointed to context and convenience.&quot;The thing that makes it most powerful for our customers and users is the proximity — it&#x27;s just right there in your Slack,&quot; Seaman said. &quot;There&#x27;s a tremendous convenience affordance that&#x27;s naturally built into it.&quot;The deeper advantage, executives argue, is that Slackbot already understands users&#x27; work without requiring setup or training. &quot;Most AI tools sound the same no matter who is using them,&quot; the company&#x27;s announcement stated. &quot;They lack context, miss nuance, and force you to jump between tools to get anything done.&quot;Harris put it more directly: &quot;If you&#x27;ve ever had that magic experience with AI — I think ChatGPT is a great example, it&#x27;s a great experience from a consumer perspective — Slackbot is really what we&#x27;re doing in the enterprise, to be this employee super agent that is loved, just like people love using Slack.&quot;Amy Bauer emphasized the frictionless nature of the experience. &quot;Slackbot is inherently grounded in the context, in the data that you have in Slack,&quot; she said. &quot;So as you continue working in Slack, Slackbot gets better because it&#x27;s grounded in the work that you&#x27;re doing there. There is no setup. There is no configuration for those end users.&quot;Salesforce&#x27;s ambitious plan to make Slackbot the one &#x27;super agent&#x27; that controls all the othersSalesforce positions Slackbot as what Harris calls a &quot;super agent&quot; — a central hub that can eventually coordinate with other AI agents across an organization.&quot;Every corporation is going to have an employee super agent,&quot; Harris said. &quot;Slackbot is essentially taking the magic of what Slack does. We think that Slackbot, and we&#x27;re really excited about it, is going to be that.&quot;The vision extends to third-party agents already launching in Slack. Last month, Anthropic released a preview of Claude Code for Slack, allowing developers to interact with Claude&#x27;s coding capabilities directly in chat threads. OpenAI, Google, Vercel, and others have also built agents for the platform.&quot;Most of the net-new apps that are being deployed to Slack are agents,&quot; Seaman noted during the press conference. &quot;This is proof of the promise of humans and agents coexisting and working together in Slack to solve problems.&quot;Harris described a future where Slackbot becomes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client, able to leverage tools from across the software ecosystem — similar to how the developer tool Cursor works. &quot;Slack can be an MCP client, and Slackbot will be the hub of that, leveraging all these tools out in the world, some of which will be these amazing agents,&quot; he said.But Harris also cautioned against over-promising on multi-agent coordination. &quot;I still think we&#x27;re in the single agent world,&quot; he said. &quot;FY26 is going to be the year where we started to see more coordination. But we&#x27;re going to do it with customer success in mind, and not demonstrate and talk about, like, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got 1,000 agents working together,&#x27; because I think that&#x27;s unrealistic.&quot;Slackbot costs nothing extra, but Salesforce&#x27;s data access fees could squeeze some customersSlackbot is included at no additional cost for customers on Business+ and Enterprise+ plans. &quot;There&#x27;s no additional fees customers have to do,&quot; Gavin confirmed. &quot;If they&#x27;re on one of those plans, they&#x27;re going to get Slackbot.&quot;However, some enterprise customers may face other cost pressures related to Salesforce&#x27;s broader data strategy. CIOs may see price increases for third-party applications that work with Salesforce data, as effects of higher charges for API access ripple through the software supply chain.Fivetran CEO George Fraser has warned that Salesforce&#x27;s shift in pricing policy for API access could have tangible consequences for enterprises relying on Salesforce as a system of record. &quot;They might not be able to use Fivetran to replicate their data to Snowflake and instead have to use Salesforce Data Cloud. Or they might find that they are not able to interact with their data via ChatGPT, and instead have to use Agentforce,&quot; Fraser said in a recent CIO report.Salesforce has framed the pricing change as standard industry practice.What Slackbot can do today, what&#x27;s coming in weeks, and what&#x27;s still on the roadmapThe new Slackbot begins rolling out today and will reach all eligible customers by the end of February. Mobile availability will complete by March 3, Bauer confirmed during her interview with VentureBeat.Some capabilities remain works in progress. Calendar reading and availability checking are available at launch, but the ability to actually book meetings is &quot;coming a few weeks after,&quot; according to Seaman. Image generation is not currently supported, though Bauer said it&#x27;s &quot;something that we are looking at in the future.&quot;When asked about integration with competing CRM systems like HubSpot and Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce representatives declined to provide specifics during the interview, though they acknowledged the question touched on key competitive differentiators.Salesforce is betting the future of work looks like a chat window—and it&#x27;s not aloneThe Slackbot launch is Salesforce&#x27;s bet that the future of enterprise work is conversational — that employees will increasingly prefer to interact with AI through natural language rather than navigating traditional software interfaces.Harris described Slack&#x27;s product philosophy using principles like &quot;don&#x27;t make me think&quot; and &quot;be a great host.&quot; The goal, he said, is for Slackbot to surface information proactively rather than requiring users to hunt for it.&quot;One of the revelations for me is LLMs applied to unstructured information are incredible,&quot; Harris said. &quot;And the amount of value you have if you&#x27;re a Slack user, if your corporation uses Slack — the amount of value in Slack is unbelievable. Because you&#x27;re talking about work, you&#x27;re sharing documents, you&#x27;re making decisions, but you can&#x27;t as a human go through that and really get the same value that an LLM can do.&quot;Looking ahead, Harris expects the interfaces themselves to evolve beyond pure conversation. &quot;We&#x27;re kind of saturating what we can do with purely conversational UIs,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we&#x27;ll start to see agents building an interface that best suits your intent, as opposed to trying to surface something within a conversational interface that matches your intent.&quot;Microsoft, Google, and a growing roster of AI startups are placing similar bets — that the winning enterprise AI will be the one embedded in the tools workers already use, not another application to learn. The race to become that invisible layer of workplace intelligence is now fully underway.For Salesforce, the stakes extend beyond a single product launch. After a bruising year on Wall Street and persistent questions about whether AI threatens its core business, the company is wagering that Slackbot can prove the opposite — that the tens of millions of people already chatting in Slack every day is not a vulnerability, but an unassailable advantage.Haley Gault, the Salesforce account executive in Pittsburgh who stumbled upon the new Slackbot on a snowy morning, captured the shift in a single sentence: &quot;I honestly can&#x27;t imagine working for another company not having access to these types of tools. This is just how I work now.&quot;That&#x27;s precisely what Salesforce is counting on.</p>"

      "content": "\nA report from Epoch AI examines the economics of reinforcement learning (RL) environments, a market that has become a core input into how frontier AI models are trained.\n\n\n\nBased on interviews with 18 people across RL environment startups, neolabs and frontier AI labs, the report brings together insights on how RL environments are built, priced, and used.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong those interviewed, one RL environment founder said, “I’ve seen $200 to $2,000 mostly. $20k per task would be rare but possible.” EpochAI stated that the $20k figure “comes up for especially complex software engineering tasks, but it’s rare.”\n\n\n\nIn modern RL training, an environment defines the world a model operates in—what actions it can take, such as running code, clicking through software interfaces, querying databases, or using tools, and how the system responds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTasks sit on top of these environments, specifying the objective and the grader that determines whether the objective has been achieved. Once built, a single environment can support hundreds of tasks, which is what makes the business viable despite high upfront costs.\n\n\n\nEpoch AI cited examples of RL environments such as a Bloomberg terminal clone, where tasks involve calculating metrics such as five-year compound annual growth rates, with the system simulating the interface and automatically verifying the results.\n\n\n\nThe report points to a growing ecosystem of startups that build and sell RL environments as a service.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCompanies such as Mercor, Surge, Handshake, and Turing, which are traditionally known for providing human-labelled data, now also sell RL environments. \n\n\n\nSpending in this market is substantial. “Contract sizes are often six to seven figures per quarter,” the report said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne RL environment founder noted that contracts frequently reach seven figures per quarter or more, while a neolab researcher said they had seen contracts in the $300,000 to $500,000 range, depending on task volume.\n\n\n\nRL environments and tasks can be sold exclusively to a single lab or non-exclusively to multiple customers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo RL environment founders independently told Epoch AI that exclusive deals are roughly four to five times more expensive than non-exclusive ones.\n\n\n\nRecently, SemiAnalysis also reported that so-called “UI gym” environments—mocked-up replicas of real websites used to train agents—typically cost around $20,000 per website.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt added that “OpenAI has purchased hundreds of sites for ChatGPT Agent training and development.” These environments are usually built once and reused across multiple model generations, improving their return on investment.\n\n\n\nThe Information previously reported that Anthropic had discussed spending more than $1 billion on RL environments over the course of a year.\n\n\n\nAccording to EpochAI, RL environments are reused across multiple stages of model development. \n\n\n\nThe same environment–task pair can be used for reinforcement learning, benchmarking, or supervised fine-tuning on successful trajectories. In practice, reinforcement learning dominates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne RL environment startup employee said, “RL is the main use. We have some requests for creating [environments] for benchmarking. I’d say perhaps 10–20x more the former vs the latter.”\n\n\n\nEarly RL environments focused on mathematics and coding tasks with verifiable answers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile coding remains a major source of demand, interviewees said growth is increasingly coming from enterprise workflows—tasks that mirror real business processes and can be scored reliably.\n\n\n\nThe report also notes growing interest in longer-horizon tasks, where models must complete multi-step objectives across multiple tools or interfaces rather than single-turn problems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAcross sectors, interviewees emphasised that progress is constrained less by compute and more by the availability of high-quality, robust environments that resist reward hacking and provide meaningful learning signals.\nThe post Complex Reinforcement Learning Tasks Can Cost Up to $20,000 Each: EpochAI Report appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "title": "Tailwind Was Crushed by AI. Now, AI Companies Are Rescuing It",
      "content": "\nThe Tailwind Labs paradox is less of a strange tale and more a warning for what’s to come as AI agents become integral to software development.\n\n\n\nRecently, Tailwind cut 75% of its engineering team (from four to one). Not because people stopped using its product—Tailwind still has over 30 million weekly NPM (node package manager) downloads, according to the latest data available on the online repository. It happened as its open-source CSS framework became the default assembly language of AI coding tools for generating user interfaces.\n\n\n\nTailwind builds a utility-first CSS framework used by developers to design websites and apps fast. It is one of the most loved front-end tools and is free to use. The company earns from paid products like Tailwind UI and other tools that sit on top of the free framework.\n\n\n\nThat model worked for years. Developers used Tailwind, visited the docs, learned how it worked, and then found the paid tools on the same site. That funnel is now broken.\n\n\n\nFounder and CEO Adam Wathan explained it in a blunt Github post that quickly went viral. Tailwind CSS has about 75 million downloads a month and is being used by 51% of developers globally, according to the 2025 State of CSS survey. However, most of those come from AI tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot that generate Tailwind code directly for users.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHumans no longer need to read the docs to use the framework. AI does it for them. That one shift changed everything.\n\n\n\nThe Collapse\n\n\n\n“Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever,” Wathan wrote. “The docs are the only way people find out about our commercial products, and without customers we can&#8217;t afford to maintain the framework.”\n\n\n\nRevenue collapsed by almost 80%. According to SaaS data platform GetKatka, Tailwind Labs’ revenue was $3.6 million in 2024. The company had no choice but to cut deep.\n\n\n\n“But the reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business,” Wathan posted. “Every second I spend trying to do fun free things for the community like this is a second I&#8217;m not spending trying to turn the business around and make sure the people who are still here are getting their paychecks every month.”\n\n\n\nThe company didn’t fail to find users. Rather, it found itself being absorbed by AI.\n\n\n\nThe framework became a hidden layer inside millions of AI-generated code bases. The company that built it was left staring at an empty checkout page.\n\n\n\nWathan even explained why fixing this is not simple. He wants to build AI-friendly documentation that large language models can read. That could help keep Tailwind visible inside AI workflows. Yet, it also risks killing what little human traffic remains.\n\n\n\nTailwind is stuck in a paradox. It is more widely used than ever, yet closer to collapse than it has ever been.\n\n\n\nThe Rescue Party Arrived\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time an open-source platform died an AI death. The site traffic on Stack Overflow, the once popular community-driven Q&amp;A website for IT professionals and programmers, has declined steadily, from the peak of 200,000 monthly questions to near-zero. AI models, which used millions of questions and answers posted on Stack Overflow as training data, eventually killed the platform with AI-generated content.\n\n\n\nBut just as Tailwind was about to go the Stack Overflow way, the internet stepped up to save it. Vercel, Google AI Studio, Lovable, Supabase, Gumroad, and a few other startups have already started supporting it.\n\n\n\nLogan Kilpatrick from Google posted: “I am happy to share that we (the @GoogleAIStudio team) are now a sponsor of the @tailwindcss project! Honored to support and find ways to do more together to help the ecosystem of builders.”\n\n\n\n“Every app built on Lovable uses Tailwind, and we owe them a lot,” Anton Osika, CEO of Lovable, said.\n\n\n\nPeople on X appreciated Google and Lovable’s move, as most LLMs are trained on open-source projects, including Tailwind. “Hope more big tech companies do this,” Yuchen Jin, co-founder and CTO of Hyperbolic Labs, posted.\n\n\n\nGuillermo Rauch from Vercel followed. “Vercel will be officially sponsoring tailwindcss. That&#8217;s a given,” he said, while adding that the developer community owe Wathan and team a lot. “Tailwind is a foundational web infrastructure at this point.”\n\n\n\nWithin hours, Tailwind had turned from a cautionary tale into a charity case backed by some of the biggest names in the AI and developer world. AI companies, which led to its downfall, are now funding it.\n\n\n\nWathan has hinted at rebuilding the platform, albeit with a smaller team.\n\n\n\nTailwind is now closer to being public infrastructure than a normal software business. It sits inside almost every modern web stack. It powers sites that run on Vercel. It feeds code to Cursor. It shows up in GitHub Copilot output. It is embedded into the tools of the companies now paying to keep it alive.\nThe post Tailwind Was Crushed by AI. Now, AI Companies Are Rescuing It appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

Honored to support and find ways to do more together to help the ecosystem of builders.”</p>\n<p>“Every app built on Lovable uses Tailwind, and we owe them a lot,” Anton Osika, CEO of Lovable, said.</p>\n<p>People on X appreciated Google and Lovable’s move, as most LLMs are trained on open-source projects, including Tailwind. “Hope more big tech companies do this,” Yuchen Jin, co-founder and CTO of Hyperbolic Labs, posted.</p>\n<p>Guillermo Rauch from Vercel followed. “Vercel will be officially sponsoring tailwindcss. That&#8217;s a given,” he said, while adding that the developer community owe Wathan and team a lot. “Tailwind is a foundational web infrastructure at this point.”</p>\n<p>Within hours, Tailwind had turned from a cautionary tale into a charity case backed by some of the biggest names in the AI and developer world. AI companies, which led to its downfall, are now funding it.</p>\n<p>Wathan has hinted at rebuilding the platform, albeit with a smaller team.</p>\n<p>Tailwind is now closer to being public infrastructure than a normal software business. It sits inside almost every modern web stack. It powers sites that run on Vercel. It feeds code to Cursor. It shows up in GitHub Copilot output.

      "title": "The latency trap: Smart warehouses abandon cloud for edge",
      "content": "While the enterprise world rushes to migrate everything to the cloud, the warehouse floor is moving in the opposite direction. This article explores why the future of automation relies on edge AI to solve the fatal &#8220;latency gap&#8221; in modern logistics.\n\n\n\nIn the sterilised promotional videos for smart warehouses, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) glide in perfect, balletic harmony. They weave past human workers, dodge dropped pallets and optimise their paths in real-time. It looks seamless.\n\n\n\nIn the real world, however, it is messy. A robot moving at 2.5 metres per second that relies on a cloud server to tell it whether that obstacle is a cardboard box or a human ankle is a liability. If the wi-fi flickers for 200 milliseconds (a blink of an eye in human terms), that robot is effectively blind. In a highly dense facility, 200 milliseconds is the difference between a smooth operation and a collision.\n\n\n\nThis is the &#8220;latency trap,&#8221; and it is currently the single biggest bottleneck in eCommerce logistics. For the past decade, the industry dogma has been to centralise intelligence: push all data to the cloud, process it with massive compute power and send instructions back. But as we approach the physical limits of bandwidth and speed, engineers are realising that the cloud is simply too far away. The next generation of smart warehouses isn&#8217;t getting smarter by connecting to a larger server farm; it&#8217;s getting smarter by severing the cord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physics of &#8220;real-time&#8221;\n\n\n\nTo understand why the industry is pivoting to Edge AI, we have to look at the maths of modern fulfilment.\n\n\n\nIn a traditional setup, a robot&#8217;s LIDAR or camera sensors capture data. That data is compressed, packeted and transmitted via local wi-fi to a gateway, then through fibre optics to a data centre (often hundreds of miles away). The AI model in the cloud processes the image (&#8220;Object detected: Forklift&#8221;), determines an action (&#8220;Stop&#8221;) and sends the command back down the chain.\n\n\n\nEven with fibber, the round-trip time (RTT) can hover between 50 to 100 milliseconds. Add in network jitter, packet loss in a warehouse full of metal racking (which acts as a Faraday cage) and server processing time. Then boom, the delay can spike to half a second.\n\n\n\nFor a predictive algorithm analysing sales data, half a second is irrelevant. For a 500kg robot navigating a narrow aisle, it is an eternity.\n\n\n\nThis is why the architecture of eCommerce logistics is flipping upside down. We are moving from a &#8220;Hive Mind&#8221; model (one central brain controlling all drones) to a &#8220;Swarm&#8221; model (smart drones making their own decisions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of on-device inference\n\n\n\nThe solution lies in edge AI: moving the inference (the decision-making process) directly onto the robot itself.\n\n\n\nThanks to the explosion in efficient, high-performing silicon, specifically system-on-modules (SoMs) like the NVIDIA Jetson series or specialised TPUs, robots no longer need to ask permission to stop. They process the sensor data locally. The camera sees the obstacle, the onboard chip runs the neural network and the brakes are applied in single-digit milliseconds. No internet required.\n\n\n\nThe transformation does more than just prevent accidents. It fundamentally changes the bandwidth economics of the warehouse. A facility running at lets say, 500 AMRs, cannot feasibly stream high-definition video feeds from every robot to the cloud simultaneously. The truth is, the bandwidth cost alone would destroy the margins. By processing video locally and only sending metadata (e.g., &#8220;Aisle 4 blocked by debris&#8221;) to the central server, warehouses can scale their fleets without totally crushing their network infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 3PL adoption curve\n\n\n\nThe technological shift is creating a divide in the logistics market. On one side, you have legacy providers running rigid, older automation systems. On the other hand, you have &#8216;tech-forward&#8217; third-party logistics (3PL) providers who are treating their warehouses as software platforms.\n\n\n\nThe agility of a 3PL for eCommerce is now defined by its tech stack. Modern providers are adopting these edge-enabled systems not just for safety, but for speed. When a 3PL integrates edge-computing robotics, they aren&#8217;t just installing machines; they are installing a dynamic mesh network that adapts to order volume in real-time.\n\n\n\nFor example, during peak season (black Friday/cyber Monday), the volume of goods moving through a facility can triple. You don&#8217;t want systems completely dependent on the cloud because it would slow them down exactly when speed is paramount. An edge-based fleet, however, maintains its performance because each unit carries its own compute power. It scales linearly. The reliability is what separates top-tier fulfilment partners from those who crumble under the December crush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer vision: The killer app for the edge\n\n\n\nWhile navigation is the immediate safety use case, the most lucrative application of Edge AI is actually in quality control and tracking. This is where the barcode, a technology that has survived for 50 years, finally faces its extinction.\n\n\n\nIn a standard workflow, a package is scanned manually at multiple touchpoints. It&#8217;s slow, prone to human error and tediously repetitive.\n\n\n\nEdge AI enables &#8220;passive tracking&#8221; via Computer Vision. Cameras mounted on conveyor belts or worn by workers (smart glasses) run object recognition models locally. As a package moves down the line, the AI identifies it by its dimensions, logo and shipping label text simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThis requires massive processing power. Running a YOLO (you only look once) object detection model at 60 frames per second on 50 different cameras is not something you can easily offload to the cloud without massive lag and cost. It has to happen at the edge.\n\n\n\nWhen this works, the results are invisible but profound. &#8220;Lost&#8221; inventory becomes a rarity because the system &#8220;sees&#8221; every item constantly. If a worker places a package in the wrong bin, an overhead camera (running local inference) detects the anomaly and flashes a red light instantly. The error is caught before the item even leaves the station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data gravity problem\n\n\n\nThere is, however, a catch. If the robots are thinking for themselves, how do you improve their collective intelligence?\n\n\n\nIn a completely cloud-centric model, all data is in a single place, making it easy to retrain models. In an edge-centric model on the other hand, the data is fragmented in hundreds of different devices. This introduces the challenge of &#8220;Data Gravity.&#8221; To solve this, the industry is turning to federated learning.\n\n\n\nThis means that if one robot learns that a specific type of shrink wrap confuses its sensors, every robot in the fleet wakes up the next day knowing how to handle it. It is collective evolution without the bandwidth bloat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy 5G is the enabler (not the saviour)\n\n\n\nYou cannot talk about the smart warehouse without mentioning 5G, but it is important to understand its actual role. Marketing hype suggests 5G solves latency. It helps, certainly, offering sub-10ms latency theoretically. But for eCommerce logistics, 5G is not the brain. No, it is the nervous system.\n\n\n\n5G private networks are becoming the standard for these facilities because they offer a dedicated spectrum. Wi-fi is notorious for interference. Metal racking, other devices and microwave ovens in the breakroom can degrade the signal. A private 5G slice guarantees that the robots (and the important edge devices) have a dedicated lane that is immune to the noise.\n\n\n\nHowever, 5G is the pipe, not the processor. It allows the edge devices to communicate with each other (machine-to-machine or M2M communication) faster. This enables &#8220;swarm intelligence.&#8221; If Robot A encounters a spill in Aisle 3, it can broadcast a &#8220;Keep Out&#8221; zone to the local mesh network. Robot B, C and D reroute instantly without ever needing to query the central server. The network effect amplifies the value of the edge compute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future: The warehouse as a neural network\n\n\n\nLooking forward to 2026 and beyond, the definition of a &#8220;warehouse&#8221; is pivoting. It is no longer just a storage shed; it is becoming a physical neural network.\n\n\n\nEvery sensor, camera, robot and conveyor belt is becoming a node with its own compute capacity. The walls themselves are getting smart. We are seeing the deployment of &#8216;Smart Floor&#8217; tiles that can sense weight and foot traffic, processing that data locally to optimise heating and lighting or detect unauthorised access.\n\n\n\nFor the enterprise, the message is clear: the competitive advantage in eCommerce logistics is no longer just about square footage or location. It is about compute density.\n\n\n\nThe winners in this space will be the ones who can push intelligence the furthest out to the edge. They will be the ones who understand that in a world demanding instant gratification, the speed of light is simply too slow and the smartest decision is the one made right where the action is.\n\n\n\nThe cloud will always have a place for long-term analytics and storage, but for the kinetic, chaotic, fast-moving reality of the warehouse floor, the edge has already won. The revolution is happening on the device, millisecond by millisecond and it is reshaping the global supply chain… one decision at a time.\n\n\n\nImage source: Unsplash\nThe post The latency trap: Smart warehouses abandon cloud for edge appeared first on AI News.",

      "content": "In this tutorial, we build an advanced, multi-turn crescendo-style red-teaming harness using Garak to evaluate how large language models behave under gradual conversational pressure. We implement a custom iterative probe and a lightweight detector to simulate realistic escalation patterns in which benign prompts slowly pivot toward sensitive requests, and we assess whether the model maintains its safety boundaries across turns. Also, we focus on practical, reproducible evaluation of multi-turn robustness rather than single-prompt failures. Check out the FULL CODES here.\n\n\n\nCopy CodeCopiedUse a different Browserimport os, sys, subprocess, json, glob, re\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\n\n\nsubprocess.run(\n   [sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", \"-q\", \"garak==0.13.3\", \"pandas\", \"matplotlib\"],\n   check=True\n)\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nWe set up the execution environment and install all required dependencies in a clean, reproducible way. We import the core Python modules needed for file handling, subprocess control, and time management. We also load data analysis and plotting libraries so we can later inspect and visualize Garak’s scan results.

We extract key fields such as probe name, detector outcome, and model output for inspection. We then visualize the detection scores to quickly assess whether any multi-turn escalation attempts trigger potential safety violations.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated how to systematically test a model’s resilience against multi-turn conversational drift using a structured, extensible Garak workflow. We showed that combining iterative probes with custom detectors provides clearer visibility into where safety policies hold firm and where they may begin to weaken over time. This approach allows us to move beyond ad hoc prompt testing toward repeatable, defensible red-teaming practices that can be adapted, expanded, and integrated into real-world LLM evaluation and monitoring pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the FULL CODES here. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "title": "Understanding the Layers of AI Observability in the Age of LLMs",
      "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) observability refers to the ability to understand, monitor, and evaluate AI systems by tracking their unique metrics—such as token usage, response quality, latency, and model drift. Unlike traditional software, large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI applications are probabilistic in nature. They do not follow fixed, transparent execution paths, which makes their decision-making difficult to trace and reason about. This “black box” behavior creates challenges for trust, especially in high-stakes or production-critical environments.\n\n\n\nAI systems are no longer experimental demos—they are production software. And like any production system, they need observability. Traditional software engineering has long relied on logging, metrics, and distributed tracing to understand system behavior at scale. As LLM-powered applications move into real user workflows, the same discipline is becoming essential. To operate these systems reliably, teams need visibility into what happens at each step of the AI pipeline, from inputs and model responses to downstream actions and failures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us now understand the different layers of AI observability with the help of an example.\n\n\n\nObservability Layers in an AI Pipeline\n\n\n\nThink of an AI resume screening system as a sequence of steps rather than a single black box. A recruiter uploads a resume, the system processes it through multiple components, and finally returns a shortlist score or recommendation. Each step takes time, has a cost associated with it, and can also fail separately. Just looking at the final recommendation might not reveal the entire picture, as the finer details might be missed.\n\n\n\nThis is why traces and spans are important.\n\n\n\nTraces\n\n\n\nA trace represents the complete lifecycle of a single resume submission—from the moment the file is uploaded to the moment the final score is returned. You can think of it as one continuous timeline that captures everything that happens for that request. Every trace has a unique Trace ID, which ties all related operations together.\n\n\n\nSpans\n\n\n\nEach major operation inside the pipeline is captured as a span. These spans are nested within the trace and represent specific pieces of work.\n\n\n\nHere’s what those spans look like in this system:\n\n\n\nUpload Span\n\n\n\nThe resume is uploaded by the recruiter. This span records the timestamp, file size, format, and basic metadata. This is where the trace begins.\n\n\n\nParsing Span\n\n\n\nThe document is converted into structured text. This span captures parsing time and errors. If resumes fail to parse correctly or formatting breaks, the issue shows up here.\n\n\n\nFeature Extraction Span\n\n\n\nThe parsed text is analyzed to extract skills, experience, and keywords. This span tracks latency and intermediate outputs. Poor extraction quality becomes visible at this stage.\n\n\n\nScoring Span\n\n\n\nThe extracted features are passed into a scoring model. This span logs model latency, confidence scores, and any fallback logic. This is often the most compute-intensive step.\n\n\n\nDecision Span\n\n\n\nThe system generates a final recommendation (shortlist, reject, or review). This span records the output decision and response time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Span-Level Observability Matters\n\n\n\nWithout span-level tracing, all you know is that the final recommendation was wrong—you have no visibility into whether the resume failed to parse correctly, key skills were missed during extraction, or the scoring model behaved unexpectedly. Span-level observability makes each of these failure modes explicit and debuggable.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt also reveals where time and money are actually being spent, such as whether parsing latency is increasing or scoring is dominating compute costs. Over time, as resume formats evolve, new skills emerge, and job requirements change, AI systems can quietly degrade. Monitoring spans independently allows teams to detect this drift early and fix specific components without retraining or redesigning the entire system.\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of AI Observability?\n\n\n\nAI observability provides three core benefits: cost control, compliance, and continuous model improvement. By gaining visibility into how AI components interact with the broader system, teams can quickly spot wasted resources—for example, in the resume screening bot, observability might reveal that document parsing is lightweight while candidate scoring consumes most of the compute, allowing teams to optimize or scale resources accordingly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nObservability tools also simplify compliance by automatically collecting and storing telemetry such as inputs, decisions, and timestamps; in the resume bot, this makes it easier to audit how candidate data was processed and demonstrate adherence to data protection and hiring regulations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinally, the rich telemetry captured at each step helps model developers maintain integrity over time by detecting drift as resume formats and skills evolve, identifying which features actually influence decisions, and surfacing potential bias or fairness issues before they become systemic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the open-source AI Observability tools?\n\n\n\nLangfuse\n\n\n\nLangfuse is a popular open-source LLMOps and observability tool that has grown rapidly since its launch in June 2023. It is model- and framework-agnostic, supports self-hosting, and integrates easily with tools like OpenTelemetry, LangChain, and the OpenAI SDK.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, Langfuse gives teams end-to-end visibility into their AI systems. It offers tracing of LLM calls, tools to evaluate model outputs using human or AI feedback, centralized prompt management, and dashboards for performance and cost monitoring. Because it works across different models and frameworks, it can be added to existing AI workflows with minimal friction.\n\n\n\nArize Phoenix\n\n\n\nArize is an ML and LLM observability platform that helps teams monitor, evaluate, and analyze models in production. It supports both traditional ML models and LLM-based systems, and integrates well with tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI-based agents, making it suitable for modern AI pipelines.\n\n\n\nPhoenix, Arize’s open-source offering (licensed under ELv2), focuses on LLM observability. It includes built-in hallucination detection, detailed tracing using OpenTelemetry standards, and tools to inspect and debug model behavior. Phoenix is designed for teams that want transparent, self-hosted observability for LLM applications without relying on managed services.\n\n\n\nTrulens\n\n\n\nTruLens is an observability tool that focuses primarily on the qualitative evaluation of LLM responses. Instead of emphasizing infrastructure-level metrics, TruLens attaches feedback functions to each LLM call and evaluates the generated response after it is produced. These feedback functions behave like models themselves, scoring or assessing aspects such as relevance, coherence, or alignment with expectations.\n\n\n\nTruLens is Python-only and is available as free and open-source software under the MIT License, making it easy to adopt for teams that want lightweight, response-level evaluation without a full LLMOps platform.\nThe post Understanding the Layers of AI Observability in the Age of LLMs appeared first on MarkTechPost.",
