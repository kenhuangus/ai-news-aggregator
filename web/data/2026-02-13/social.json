      "content": "Lots of folks spread false narratives about how ARC-1 was created in response to LLMs, or how ARC-2 was only created because ARC-1 was saturated. Setting the record straight:\n\n1. ARC-1 was designed 2017-2019 and released in 2019 (pre LLMs).\n\n2. The coming of ARC-2 was announced in May 2022 (pre ChatGPT).\n\n3. By mid-2024, there was still essentially no progress on ARC-1.\n\n4. All progress on ARC-1 & ARC-2 came from a new paradigm, test-time adaptation models, starting in late 2024 and ramping up through 2025.\n\n5. Progress happened specifically *because* research moved away from what ARC was intended to challenge (static DL), toward what ARC was intended to encourage (test-time adaptation). ARC was meant to steer AI research towards fluid intelligence, and it is only by implementing fluid intelligence that it could be solved.\n\n6. To this day, base LLMs (no test-time adaptation) *still* perform abysmally low on ARC despite a 50,000x scaleup since 2020, which confirms what we predicted about this paradigm not being capable of fluid intelligence and therefore not being capable of solving ARC.\n\n7. ARC-3 was announced in February 2025, back when ARC-2 was completely unsaturated. ARC-3 is not in response to ARC-2 getting saturated.\n\n8. We never claimed solving ARC would be proof of having achieved AGI; all the way back to 2021-2022 and every single year since we made it very explicit that it would NOT be proof of AGI. ARC is a research tool that was intended to steer AI research towards fluid intelligence, which it did.",

      "content_html": "<p>Lots of folks spread false narratives about how ARC-1 was created in response to LLMs, or how ARC-2 was only created because ARC-1 was saturated. Setting the record straight:</p>\n<p>1. ARC-1 was designed 2017-2019 and released in 2019 (pre LLMs).</p>\n<p>2. The coming of ARC-2 was announced in May 2022 (pre ChatGPT).</p>\n<p>3. By mid-2024, there was still essentially no progress on ARC-1.</p>\n<p>4. All progress on ARC-1 &amp; ARC-2 came from a new paradigm, test-time adaptation models, starting in late 2024 and ramping up through 2025.</p>\n<p>5. Progress happened specifically *because* research moved away from what ARC was intended to challenge (static DL), toward what ARC was intended to encourage (test-time adaptation). ARC was meant to steer AI research towards fluid intelligence, and it is only by implementing fluid intelligence that it could be solved.</p>\n<p>6. To this day, base LLMs (no test-time adaptation) *still* perform abysmally low on ARC despite a 50,000x scaleup since 2020, which confirms what we predicted about this paradigm not being capable of fluid intelligence and therefore not being capable of solving ARC.</p>\n<p>7. ARC-3 was announced in February 2025, back when ARC-2 was completely unsaturated. ARC-3 is not in response to ARC-2 getting saturated.</p>\n<p>8. We never claimed solving ARC would be proof of having achieved AGI; all the way back to 2021-2022 and every single year since we made it very explicit that it would NOT be proof of AGI. ARC is a research tool that was intended to steer AI research towards fluid intelligence, which it did.</p>"

Is Shumer credible? Did he give a single concrete example? \n\nPeople gonna believe what they want to believe, but here are 7 critical points most people missed:\n\n• Shumer’s blog post is weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech, but stumbles on the facts, especially with respect to reliability. He gives no actual data to support this claim that the latest coding systems can (reliably) write “perfect” whole complex apps without making errors.  \n\n• When he describes how AI’s are doing longer and longer tasks on METR’s famous task-time benchmark, he neglects to say the criterion on that benchmark is 50% correct, not 100%, and that the benchmark is only about coding and not tasks in general. No AI system can reliably do every five-hour long task humans can do without error, or even close. But you wouldn’t know that reading Shumer’s blog, which largely ignores all the hallucination and boneheaded errors that are so common in every day experience. \n\n• Shumer didn’t cite the new Caltech/Stanford article that reviews a wide range of reasoning errors in so-called reasoning models [or the Apple reasoning paper or the ASU mirage paper, etc]. The picture he sells just isn’t realistic, however much people might wish it were true. \n\n• Shumer is the guy who was once famous for apparently exaggerated claims about a big model of his that didn’t replicate and that many people saw as fraud; he likes to sell big. But that doesn’t mean we should take him seriously.\n\n• Shumer made no reference to a different METR study showed that coders sometimes imagine big productivity gains where they actually lost productivity. (Even though he selectively mentioned their other well-known study).\n\n• He also didn’t acknowledge that other user’s experience is certainly not “it’s usually perfect.” @KelseyTuocreported a few weeks back that Claude Code was sometimes perfect, and other times maddening. (Example: “Sometimes, Claude is absolutely the worst coworker you’ve ever had. At one point, it deleted every single one of the phoneme files of each English sound pronounced [that she was working with in her app] absolutely correctly, which I had personally emailed an English teacher to secure permission to use, and replaced them with AI-generated sounds which were all subtly wrong.”) Shumer glosses over that kind of experience.  ￼\n•LLMs write code wicked fast, but some coders are starting to report burnout, and only relatively modest gains relative to that burnout, as a new story from Connie Loizos at Tech Crunch just reported.\n\n• Shumer is actually correct that something has changed recently. You really can let things rip more in the most recent systems. Bit, quoting from a developer friend “sometimes!  [it] will come out with the right answer. … Sometimes… [But] ultimately, I think this makes it more dangerous …. Generally, the closer these systems are to appearing right, the more dangerous they become…”\n\n• The security of the autogenerated code is very much in question. \n\nThe bottom line is this: LLMs are certainly coding more, but it’s not clear that the code they are creating is secure or trustworthy. Shumer’s presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere. \n\nA lot of people may have taken his post seriously, but they shouldn’t have.\n\nAdapted from my newsletter, Marcus on AI (nearly 100k subscribers).",

This short course teaches you A2A, the open protocol standardizing how agents discover each other and communicate. Since IBM’s ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) joined forces with A2A, A2A has emerged as the industry standard.\n\nIn this course, you'll build a healthcare multi-agent system where agents built with different frameworks, such as Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) and LangGraph, collaborate through A2A. You'll wrap each agent as an A2A server, build A2A clients to connect to them, and orchestrate them into sequential and hierarchical workflows.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Expose agents from different frameworks as A2A servers to make them discoverable and interoperable\n- Chain A2A agents sequentially using ADK, where one agent's output feeds into the next\n- Connect A2A agents to external data sources using MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n- Deploy A2A agents using Agent Stack, IBM's open-source infrastructure\n\nJoin and learn the protocol standardizing agent collaboration! \nhttps://t.co/5EDqpuvd0z",

Is Shumer credible? Did he give a single concrete example? \n\nPeople gonna believe what they want to believe, here are 8 or 9 critical points most people missed:\n\n• Shumer’s blog post is weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech, but stumbles on the facts, especially with respect to reliability. He gives no actual data to support this claim that the latest coding systems can write whole complex apps without making errors.  \n\n• When he describes how AI’s are doing longer and longer tasks on METR’s famous task-time benchmark, he neglects to say the criterion on that benchmark is 50% correct, not 100%, and that the benchmark is only about coding and not tasks in general. No AI system can reliably do every five-hour long task humans can do without error, or even close. But you wouldn’t know that reading Shumer’s blog, which largely ignores all the hallucination and boneheaded errors that are so common in every day experience. \n\n• Shumer didn’t cite the new Caltech/Stanford article that reviews a wide range of reasoning errors in so-called reasoning models [or the Apple reasoning paper or the ASU mirage paper, etc]. The picture he sells just isn’t realistic, however much people might wish it were true. \n\n• Shumer is the guy who was once famous for apparently exaggerated claims about a big model of his that didn’t replicate and that many people saw as fraud; he likes to sell big. But that doesn’t mean we should take him seriously.\n\n• Shumer made no reference to a different METR study showed that coders sometimes imagine big productivity gains where they actually lost productivity. (Even though he selectively mentioned their other well-known study).\n\n• He also didn’t acknowledge that other user’s experience is certainly not “it’s usually perfect.” @KelseyTuocreported a few weeks back that Claude Code was sometimes perfect, and other times maddening. (Example: “Sometimes, Claude is absolutely the worst coworker you’ve ever had. At one point, it deleted every single one of the phoneme files of each English sound pronounced [that she was working with in her app] absolutely correctly, which I had personally emailed an English teacher to secure permission to use, and replaced them with AI-generated sounds which were all subtly wrong.”) Shumer glosses over that kind of experience.  ￼\n•LLMs write code wicked fast, but some coders are starting to report burnout, and only relatively modest gains relative to that burnout, as a new story from Connie Loizos at Tech Crunch just reported.\n\n• Shumer is actually correct that something has changed recently. You really can let things rip more in the most recent systems. Bit, quoting from a developer friend “sometimes!  [it] will come out with the right answer. … Sometimes… [But] ultimately, I think this makes it more dangerous …. Generally, the closer these systems are to appearing right, the more dangerous they become…”\n\n• The security of the autogenerated code is very much in question. \n\nThe bottom line is this: LLMs are certainly coding more, but it’s not clear that the code they are creating is secure or trustworthy. Shumer’s presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere. \n\nA lot of people may have taken his post seriously, but they shouldn’t have.\n\nAdapted from my newsletter, Marcus on AI (nearly 100k subscribers).",
