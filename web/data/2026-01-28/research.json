Quantitatively, we find that severe forms of disempowerment potential occur in fewer than one in a thousand conversations, though rates are substantially higher in personal domains like relationships and lifestyle. Qualitatively, we uncover several concerning patterns, such as validation of persecution narratives and grandiose identities with emphatic sycophantic language, definitive moral judgments about third parties, and complete scripting of value-laden personal communications that users appear to implement verbatim. Analysis of historical trends reveals an increase in the prevalence of disempowerment potential over time.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.18984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.",

This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.</p>"

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.",

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.</p>"

Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.",

Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19831v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE).

While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks.

Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023).

      "content": "arXiv:2601.18987v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.",

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p>"

We further distinguish between SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic (quantised models), whose expressive power remains within regular languages, and SSM with unbounded precision, which can capture counting properties and non-regular languages. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison between these different SSM variants and known results on transformers, thereby clarifying how the two architectures relate in terms of expressive power.</p>"

However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones.

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy.

This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.",

This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.</p>"

Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways.

These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths.

Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.</p>"

To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.   To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions.

This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training.

Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.</p>"

While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \\textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \\textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \\textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\\% file-level and 56.4\\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\\% fewer turns and 68.9\\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.</p>"

Traditional test-time defenses largely operate under the paradigm of internal diagnosis methods like model repairing or input robustness, yet these approaches are often fragile under advanced attacks as they remain entangled with the victim model's corrupted parameters. We propose a paradigm shift from Internal Diagnosis to External Semantic Auditing, arguing that effective defense requires decoupling safety from the victim model via an independent, semantically grounded auditor.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol.

On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models.

On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs.

Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\\times$ speedup.

In this work, we present \\emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks.

In this work, we present \\emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.</p>"

From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks. Our code is released at https://github.com/MarquisDarwin/EAWM.</p>"

To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL.

Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%.

This work investigates their application to the numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows, with a view toward incorporating physical constraints such as incompressibility in the probabilistic forecasting framework enabled by generative networks. For that purpose, we explore different conditional, score-based diffusion models where the divergence-free constraint is imposed by the Leray spectral projector, and autoregressive conditioning is aimed at stabilizing the forecasted flow snapshots at distant time horizons. The proposed models are run on a benchmark turbulence problem, namely a Kolmogorov flow, which allows for a fairly detailed analytical and numerical treatment and thus simplifies the evaluation of the numerical methods used to simulate it. Numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to compare the advantages and limitations of the diffusion models we have implemented and appraise their performances, including: (i) in-distribution assessment over the same time horizons and for similar physical conditions as the ones seen during training; (ii) rollout predictions over time horizons unseen during training; and (iii) out-of-distribution tests for forecasting flows markedly different from those seen during training.

A key challenge in achieving this goal is having access to robust methodologies to understand where species occur and how they relate to each other within broader ecological communities. Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations.",

Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence.

In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.",

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19435v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Sustainable monetization of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical open challenge. Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.

The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.18823v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods.

We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data.

The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.

This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19510v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \\ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution.

      "content_html": "<p>arXiv:2601.19510v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \\ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.",

Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them. Using traffic navigation systems as examples, we show how even passive tools can exhibit emergent performativity, while advanced configurations risk performative lock-in.

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM.

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.</p>"

While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes.

The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.18929v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for surgical scene understanding. However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward.

It was cool because I got to talk with an actual Chinese AI about topics like: the representation of Chinese AI in \"AI 2027\"; representations of AI in the \"Culture\" SF series versus the \"Wandering Earth\" movies; consequences of Fast Takeoff; comparisons of China and America in general; and Chinese ideas about AI society and superintelligence. (An aligned Chinese superintelligence might be a heavenly bureaucrat or a Taoist sage.)It was one of those AI conversations where you know that something really new is happening, and I now consider GLM to be as interesting as the leading American models.

Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting.

While prior work has extensively studied phonetic and speaker information in DSRTs, how accent information is encoded in DSRTs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of accent information in DSRTs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation.

We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation. Our work highlights the importance of accent-aware evaluation and provides practical guidance for designing DSRTs for accent-controlled speech generation.</p>"

Its stability can be explained by it giving everyone an ostensibly equal share in determining the direction of governance[2], thus theoretically incentivizing the population at large to protect it from anything which would lead to them losing their share.Swarming as LeverageThe basic strategy of a revolution leverages an overwhelming numerical advantage to overcome the coercion produced by an existing power structure.To paint an extreme example, an unarmed fraction of the revolution is sacrificed to absorb a soldier's bullets, while the remainder swarms him before he has a chance to reload. Now they're no longer unarmed.The effectiveness of such a movement compounds once the other guardians of the incumbent see their own position as untenable, and people on the inside start defecting on the original power structure to make it in a post-revolutionary equilibrium, thus turning the revolution into a self-fulfilling prophecy.The Erosion of LeverageImportantly, humans swarming a power structure doesn't work anymore in a post-AGI world.Your union threatens to strike, and your boss can now say \"goodbye\" to all members without worrying about cuts to production.You shoot down one slaughterbot, and a hundred more are deployed in the same instant.Pot...</p>"

Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection.

A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation.

In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting.

In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting. The evaluation metrics and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VC-Bench-1B67/.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19506v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19580v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities.

In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19871v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust.

Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.</p>"

These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\.

Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently.

Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently. This work provides insights into how strategies and preferences evolve with repeated interaction and offers design implications for robots that adapt to user needs over time.</p>"

These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for improving the operational efficiency of automated storage systems under uncertainty. It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\\Theta(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$.",

      "content_html": "<p>arXiv:2601.19144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for improving the operational efficiency of automated storage systems under uncertainty. It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\\Theta(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19674v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.",

      "content_html": "<p>arXiv:2601.19674v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.</p>"

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size.

This paper presents a case study of integrating three major public chemical repositories: PubChem (176 million compounds), ChEMBL, and eMolecules, to construct a curated dataset for molecular property prediction. We investigate whether byte-offset indexing can practically overcome brute-force scalability limits while preserving data integrity at hundred-million scale.

We investigate whether byte-offset indexing can practically overcome brute-force scalability limits while preserving data integrity at hundred-million scale.

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets.

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.</p>"

We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion.

In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator.

A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.</p>"

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19246v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.   Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations.   Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.   Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.",

Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.</p>"

The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace.

Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively.

Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios.

You heard about a real-time voice chat plugin you can use to talk to Clawd wherever you are, and that seems convenient, so you set it up. One day, you're driving home, and an idea for a project comes to you. Instead of writing a note, you just call up Clawd. You ramble for a few minutes, describing your idea. Clawd starts working. It pings you a few times with clarifying questions that you answer. 30 minutes later, Clawd calls you back, saying it's done. You get home and Clawd built you a working MVP. It's a little rough around the edges, but it actually works. You think \"Wow... I can build software while I drive? That's crazy.\" You tell your girlfriend about this and she admits, yeah, that is actually kinda cool. You got a taste of the magic elixir. Now you're addicted. You've been working on your project for a few weeks now and you've decided to turn it into a SaaS business. You realize Clawd is pretty capable, and you start trusting it a little more. One evening, like everyone else you know, you're working on your AI SaaS startup and you realize you're sick and tired of all these customer support emails informing you of bugs in your vibe-coded webapp. Before going to sleep, you route these emails directly to Clawd instead. The next morning, your eyes flutter o...</p>"

Among many other examples, Sabien highlights the phenomenon of gift economies: a high-trust culture in which everyone is eager to help each other out whenever they can is a nicer place to live than a low-trust culture in which every transaction must be carefully tracked for fear of enabling free-riders. I'm skeptical of the extent to which differences between high- and low-trust cultures can be explained by self-fulfilling prophecies as opposed to pre-existing differences in trust-worthiness, but I do grant that self-fulfilling expectations can sometimes play a role: if I insist on always being paid back immediately and in full, it makes sense that that would impede the development of gift-economy culture among my immediate contacts.
