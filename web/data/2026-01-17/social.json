      "content": "Interesting social media job: What if your product doesn't fit the narrative?\n\n@sundayrobotics is in that spot, and needs a storyteller to help find and feed customers. \n\nIt isn't a full humanoid. It can't walk up stairs.\n\nIt doesn't have hands that can deal cards, or play ping pong.\n\nIt isn't able to run on the street like @Figure_robot or do Kung Fu or dance next to humans, like we have seen many of the Chinese ones. \n\n@adcock_brett will never compare his robot to it (robot entrepreneurs tell me that their biggest days so far were when Brett fights with them, which causes the X algorithm to push the fight to everyone's feed).\n\n@cixliv will never buy one to fight in his robot fights. \n\nIt doesn't have a chance against @elonmusk and his Optimus. The founder of Sunday isn't someone that has a huge social media platform, or, even a name you would recognize. Heck, I had dinner with him last week at CES and I barely remember his name. Tony something. \n\nTaking this job running social media for Sunday would be torture. It looks goofy. It doesn't cause people to dream. I doubt it ever will go viral, even though it got a nice bump from the AI industry when it was first revealed. \n\nIt isn't sexy. It doesn't fit the narrative.\n\nIt'd be like eating glass, forcing the narrative here on X and other places to generate hype will be horrible. \n\nYet I'm intrigued, I must like eating glass. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause its approach has a good potential customer base. \n\n25% of US adults have bad knees. \n\nMy best friend is one of them. \n\nThat's 65 million. Huge TAM (total addressable market).\n\nMy friend can't stand for long. Soon will have knee replacement, but even then he'll probably have a tough time bending over to pick a sock off the floor that he dropped.\n\nBut here's the rub: he can't afford a @1x_tech NEO. Or a Figure. Or a Tesla Optimus. All of which are expected to be $20,000, or more. \n\nHe also doesn't need a robot that can dance, fight, or play ping pong. \n\nHe just needs a little extra help around the home. Picking up socks. Bringing him a remote. Putting dishes in the sink. Maybe someday an Optimus or a Neo will get cheap enough that he can have one of those wash the dishes, but let's be honest those days are years away. \n\nSunday's approach should bring us a robot for much less money than all those others. And, because it is on wheels, should have other advantages, like battery life, and safety. Plus it will be easier to manufacture than any of those others, so will be more likely to be in his home sooner than any of those others.\n\nAt CES last week I saw two of the Chinese humanoids fall. A wheeled approach should never fall. And having legs and standing takes quite a bit of power where wheels use a lot less.\n\nSo, someone who takes this social media job will have to be skilled at something that few are: finding customers and positioning. \n\nWhat would I do if I had this job?\n\nAdmit its limitations. And turn those into the brand. \n\nPage Alloo, one of the world's top positioning geniuses, taught me this (I worked for her partner and helped her a bit with her computers). \n\nTurn the positives into a negative. Turn the negatives into a positive, she would tell me.\n\nWhat are the positives?\n\nTwo fingered hands (grippers) can do a lot. And are far cheaper, and are more reliable, than the hands that can play ping pong. \n\nThe @SharpaRobotics hands we all were wowed by at CES cost about $50,000. Now, yeah, they will come down in cost someday, but not in 2026. They are too hard to make, require too many computers to deal with the data from having 1,000 sensors in each finger (and a camera in the palm). \n\nPlus, there is how it looks. A humanoid brings many expectations. I watched dozens of people hug the Neo, including AI genius @karpathy. No one will feel impelled to hug the Sunday. It looks like one of those Playmobile toys I used to love playing with as a kid.\n\nIf my friend had one of these in his home, moving around, I wouldn't feel like it would have super human capabilities, or want to hug it, or talk to it. It'd be just like his refrigerator, just a piece of technology that is there, but won't bring crazy expectations, like I will have when an Optimus arrives. When that comes it better play some ping pong with me. \n\nThis is why Sunday caught my attention. They are taking shitty hardware and making it do a lot of things with AI innovations. \n\nNow, the question for whoever gets this job, can he or she get through the algorithm? I don't believe so. You need to have a robot that can run, dance, fight, entertain, or do Kung Fu to do that. \n\nSo, most of their effort should be to find communities of people with bad knees who need a little extra help around the house. \n\nMaybe do a community, newsgroup, discord channel, etc for people with bad knees, or have other problems bending over to pick socks off of the floor (paralyzed people, for instance, who are waiting in line to get a Neuralink). And who aren't wealthy enough to buy one with hands with 10 fingers. \n\nThat can keep to the message and avoid getting in fights with Elon or Brett? \n\nAre you someone who can do that? Who can find people around people like that who can help them see the value in such a robot? \n\nAnd maybe find more investors who see the value in such an approach?\n\nThen this job is for you.",

It looks like one of those Playmobile toys I used to love playing with as a kid.</p>\n<p>If my friend had one of these in his home, moving around, I wouldn't feel like it would have super human capabilities, or want to hug it, or talk to it. It'd be just like his refrigerator, just a piece of technology that is there, but won't bring crazy expectations, like I will have when an Optimus arrives. When that comes it better play some ping pong with me.</p>\n<p>This is why Sunday caught my attention. They are taking shitty hardware and making it do a lot of things with AI innovations.</p>\n<p>Now, the question for whoever gets this job, can he or she get through the algorithm? I don't believe so. You need to have a robot that can run, dance, fight, entertain, or do Kung Fu to do that.</p>\n<p>So, most of their effort should be to find communities of people with bad knees who need a little extra help around the house.</p>\n<p>Maybe do a community, newsgroup, discord channel, etc for people with bad knees, or have other problems bending over to pick socks off of the floor (paralyzed people, for instance, who are waiting in line to get a Neuralink). And who aren't wealthy enough to buy one with hands with 10 fingers.</p>\n<p>That can keep to the message and avoid getting in fights with Elon or Brett?</p>\n<p>Are you someone who can do that? Who can find people around people like that who can help them see the value in such a robot?</p>\n<p>And maybe find more investors who see the value in such an approach?</p>\n<p>Then this job is for you.</p>"

Is a SQL db just a metadata layer that poitns to the file content? Vector search is still nice, but you can decouple initial retrieval from the final context the LLM sees during generation, if you just give the LLM access to the entire file. \n\n---------\n\nWhat I really wanted to highlight though is the *unreasonable effectiveness* of \n1. the file interface\n2. file search operations\n\nHaving a file tool interface allows the agent to dynamically scroll up and down a file, which eliminates the need to worry about chunking at all. \n\nUsing simple file search like `ls` and `grep` is unreasonably effective up to a few hundred docs. And you don't really need a db at that scale. At higher scales, I'd be curious to see how we can combine the file interface with a more scalable search/persistence layer.",

Is a SQL db just a metadata layer that poitns to the file content? Vector search is still nice, but you can decouple initial retrieval from the final context the LLM sees during generation, if you just give the LLM access to the entire file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>What I really wanted to highlight though is the *unreasonable effectiveness* of</p>\n<p>1. the file interface</p>\n<p>2. file search operations</p>\n<p>Having a file tool interface allows the agent to dynamically scroll up and down a file, which eliminates the need to worry about chunking at all.</p>\n<p>Using simple file search like `ls` and `grep` is unreasonably effective up to a few hundred docs. And you don't really need a db at that scale. At higher scales, I'd be curious to see how we can combine the file interface with a more scalable search/persistence layer.</p>"
