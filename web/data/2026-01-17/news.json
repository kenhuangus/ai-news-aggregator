The company also aims to improve its API and marketing automation for clients, creating high-capacity marketing content systems.\n\n\n\nThis funding round comes after Higgsfield achieved a $200 million annual run rate in less than nine months, doubling from $100 million in just about two months.\n\n\n\nSince its launch in April 2025, the platform has gained over 15 million users globally and currently generates 4.5 million videos per day. Higgsfield is transforming marketing production through high-quality, automated creative generation at scale, resulting in over three billion social media impressions, making it one of the most popular generative AI platforms in terms of social media presence.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Traditional video production wasn&#8217;t built for the pace modern marketing demands,&#8221; Mashrabov said in a statement. &#8220;In that world, a 16-year-old with taste can outperform a studio pipeline, because on social media the advantage goes to what earns attention and converts, not what took the longest to produce.&#8221;\n\n\n\nHiggsfield reports that 85% of its users are social media marketers, with 80% already producing commercial work, indicating that platform adoption has matured beyond casual content creation. A key insight is the rapid uptake of generative video among marketers, who are now managing full workflows, from ideation to publishing, within a single system.\n\n\n\nMoreover, many direct-to-consumer advertisers are transitioning to a generative AI-first model, using automation pipelines like URL-to-ad to quickly create on-brand video variations from product pages. Some customers using Higgsfield&#8217;s beta marketing automation product are reportedly investing over $200,000 annually.\n\n\n\nJeff Herbst, a Higgsfield board member and former head of corporate development at NVIDIA, said the company&#8217;s adoption signals a move from pilots to embedded production use.\n\n\n\n&#8220;When a platform moves beyond pilots and into daily production across enterprises, the outcome is clear,&#8221; Herbst said.\nThe post AI Video Startup Higgsfield Raises $130 Mn in Series A, Reports $200 Mn ARR appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "content": "\nGoogle on January 15, announced TranslateGemma, a new suite of open translation models built on Gemma 3, to support text translation across 55 languages.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe models are available in 4B, 12B, and 27B parameter sizes and are intended for use across mobile, local, and cloud environments, the company said. According to Google, TranslateGemma offers higher translation quality with fewer parameters by distilling capabilities from its larger Gemini models.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By distilling the knowledge of our most advanced large models into compact, high-performance open models, we have created a suite where efficiency doesn’t require a compromise on quality,” the company said in its announcement.\n\n\n\nTranslateGemma models are available through multiple channels, including Kaggle, Hugging Face, Vertex AI, and Google’s Gemma Cookbook.\n\n\n\nThe models were trained and evaluated across 55 language pairs, covering high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. Google said TranslateGemma reduced translation error rates across all tested languages compared to the baseline Gemma models. In addition, the company trained the system on nearly 500 more language pairs to allow researchers to fine-tune models for specific use cases.\n\n\n\nGoogle said internal tests showed the 12B TranslateGemma model outperformed the larger Gemma 3 27B baseline on the WMT24++ benchmark using the MetricX framework. The 4B model delivered performance comparable to the 12B baseline, making it suitable for on-device inference.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI has also introduced ChatGPT Translate, a web-based translation tool. The service is positioned as an alternative to Google Translate and uses ChatGPT models to translate text across more than 50 languages. It focuses on text input with automatic language detection and can be used without an account, though signing in enables additional features.\n\n\n\nThe tool uses a dual-panel layout, with one section for input text and another for the translated output. Users can select source and target languages from dropdown menus. ChatGPT Translate also allows users to adjust the tone of translations, such as making them more formal, simplified, or suited for academic use.\nThe post Google Launches TranslateGemma, Takes On ChatGPT Translate appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

      "title": "Google AI Releases TranslateGemma: A New Family of Open Translation Models Built on Gemma 3 with Support for 55 Languages",
      "content": "Google AI has released TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models built on Gemma 3 and targeted at 55 languages. The family comes in 4B, 12B and 27B parameter sizes. It is designed to run across devices from mobile and edge hardware to laptops and a single H100 GPU or TPU instance in the cloud.\n\n\n\nTranslateGemma is not a separate architecture. It is Gemma 3 specialized for translation through a two stage post training pipeline. (1) supervised fine tuning on large parallel corpora. (2) Reinforcement learning that optimizes translation quality with a multi signal reward ensemble. The goal is to push translation quality while keeping the general instruction following behavior of Gemma 3. \n\n\n\nSupervised fine tuning on synthetic and human parallel data\n\n\n\nThe supervised fine tuning stage starts from the public Gemma 3 4B, 12B and 27B checkpoints. The research team uses parallel data that combines human translations with high quality synthetic translations generated by Gemini models.\n\n\n\nSynthetic data is produced from monolingual sources with a multi step procedure. The pipeline selects candidate sentences and short documents, feeds them to Gemini 2.5 Flash, and then filters outputs with MetricX 24 QE to keep only examples that show clear quality gains. This is applied across all WMT24 plus plus language pairs plus 30 more language pairs.\n\n\n\nLow resource languages receive human generated parallel data from the SMOL and GATITOS datasets. SMOL covers 123 languages and GATITOS covers 170 languages. This improves coverage of scripts and language families that are under represented in publicly available web parallel data. \n\n\n\nThe final supervised fine tuning mixture also keeps 30 percent generic instruction following data from the original Gemma 3 mixture. This is important. Without it, the model would over specialize on pure translation and lose general LLM behavior such as following instructions or doing simple reasoning in context.\n\n\n\nTraining uses the Kauldron SFT (Supervised Fine tuning) tooling with the AdaFactor optimizer. The learning rate is 0.0001 with batch size 64 for 200000 steps. All model parameters are updated except the token embeddings, which are frozen. Freezing embeddings helps preserve representation quality for languages and scripts that do not appear in the supervised fine tuning data. \n\n\n\nReinforcement learning with a translation focused reward ensemble\n\n\n\nAfter supervised fine tuning, TranslateGemma runs a reinforcement learning phase on top of the same translation data mixture. The reinforcement learning objective uses several reward models.\n\n\n\nThe reward ensemble includes:\n\n\n\n\nMetricX 24 XXL QE, a learned regression metric that approximates MQM scores and is used here in quality estimation mode without a reference.\n\n\n\nGemma AutoMQM QE, a span level error predictor fine tuned from Gemma 3 27B IT on MQM labeled data. It produces token level rewards based on error type and severity.\n\n\n\nChrF, a character n gram overlap metric that compares model output with synthetic references and is rescaled to match the other rewards.\n\n\n\nA Naturalness Autorater that uses the policy model as an LLM judge and produces span level penalties for segments that do not sound like native text.\n\n\n\nA generalist reward model from the Gemma 3 post training setup that keeps reasoning and instruction following ability intact. \n\n\n\n\nTranslateGemma uses reinforcement learning algorithms that combine sequence level rewards with token level advantages. Span level rewards from AutoMQM and the Naturalness Autorater attach directly to the affected tokens. These token advantages are added to sequence advantages computed from reward to go and then batch normalized. This improves credit assignment compared with pure sequence level reinforcement learning.\n\n\n\nBenchmark results on WMT24++\n\n\n\nTranslateGemma is evaluated on the WMT24++ benchmark using MetricX 24 and Comet22. MetricX is lower better and correlates with MQM error counts. Comet22 is higher better and measures adequacy and fluency. \n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09012\n\n\nThe above Table from the research pape summarizes results for English centered evaluation over 55 language pairs. \n\n\n\n\n27B: Gemma 3 baseline has MetricX 4.04 and Comet22 83.1. TranslateGemma 27B reaches MetricX 3.09 and Comet22 84.4.\n\n\n\n12B: Gemma 3 baseline has MetricX 4.86 and Comet22 81.6. TranslateGemma 12B reaches MetricX 3.60 and Comet22 83.5.\n\n\n\n4B: Gemma 3 baseline has MetricX 6.97 and Comet22 77.2. TranslateGemma 4B reaches MetricX 5.32 and Comet22 80.1. \n\n\n\n\nThe key pattern is that TranslateGemma improves quality for every model size. At the same time, model scale interacts with specialization. The 12B TranslateGemma model surpasses the 27B Gemma 3 baseline. The 4B TranslateGemma model reaches quality similar to the 12B Gemma 3 baseline. This means a smaller translation specialized model can replace a larger baseline model for many machine translation workloads.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09012\n\n\nA language level breakdown in the above appendix table from the research paper shows that these gains appear across all 55 language pairs. For example, MetricX improves from 1.63 to 1.19 for English to German, 2.54 to 1.88 for English to Spanish, 3.90 to 2.72 for English to Hebrew, and 5.92 to 4.45 for English to Swahili. Improvements are also large for harder cases such as English to Lithuanian, English to Estonian and English to Icelandic.\n\n\n\nHuman evaluation on WMT25 with MQM confirms this trend. TranslateGemma 27B usually yields lower MQM scores, that is fewer weighted errors, than Gemma 3 27B, with especially strong gains for low resource directions such as English to Marathi, English to Swahili and Czech to Ukrainian. There are two notable exceptions. For German as target both systems are very close. For Japanese to English TranslateGemma shows a regression caused mainly by named entity errors, even though other error categories improve.\n\n\n\nMultimodal translation and interface for developers\n\n\n\nTranslateGemma inherits the image understanding stack of Gemma 3. The research team evaluates image translation on the Vistra benchmark. They select 264 images that each contain a single text instance. The model receives only the image plus a prompt that asks it to translate the text in the image. There is no separate bounding box input and no explicit OCR step. \n\n\n\nOn this setting, TranslateGemma 27B improves MetricX from 2.03 to 1.58 and Comet22 from 76.1 to 77.7. The 4B variant shows smaller but positive gains. The 12B model improves MetricX but has a slightly lower Comet22 score than the baseline. Overall, the research team concludes that TranslateGemma retains the multimodal ability of Gemma 3 and that text translation improvements mostly carry over to image translation.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nTranslateGemma is a specialized Gemma 3 variant for translation: TranslateGemma is a suite of open translation models derived from Gemma 3, with 4B, 12B and 27B parameter sizes, optimized for 55 languages through a two stage pipeline, supervised fine tuning then reinforcement learning with translation focused rewards.\n\n\n\nTraining combines Gemini synthetic data with human parallel corpora: The models are fine tuned on a mixture of high quality synthetic parallel data generated by Gemini and human translated data, which improves coverage for both high resource and low resource languages while preserving general LLM capabilities from Gemma 3. \n\n\n\nReinforcement learning uses an ensemble of quality estimation rewards: After supervised fine tuning, TranslateGemma applies reinforcement learning driven by an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX QE and AutoMQM, that explicitly target translation quality and fluency rather than generic chat behavior.\n\n\n\nSmaller models match or beat larger Gemma 3 baselines on WMT24++: On WMT24++ across 55 languages, all TranslateGemma sizes show consistent improvements over Gemma 3, with the 12B model surpassing the 27B Gemma 3 baseline and the 4B model reaching quality comparable to the 12B baseline, which reduces compute requirements for a given translation quality level.\n\n\n\nModels retain multimodal abilities and are released as open weights: TranslateGemma keeps Gemma 3 image text translation capabilities and improves performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark, and the weights are released as open models on Hugging Face and Vertex AI, enabling local and cloud deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Paper, Model Weights and Technical details. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "title": "Black Forest Labs Releases FLUX.2 [klein]: Compact Flow Models for Interactive Visual Intelligence",
      "content": "Black Forest Labs releases FLUX.2 [klein], a compact image model family that targets interactive visual intelligence on consumer hardware. FLUX.2 [klein] extends the FLUX.2 line with sub second generation and editing, a unified architecture for text to image and image to image, and deployment options that range from local GPUs to cloud APIs, while keeping state of the art image quality. \n\n\n\nFrom FLUX.2 [dev] to interactive visual intelligence\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [dev] is a 32 billion parameter rectified flow transformer for text conditioned image generation and editing, including composition with multiple reference images, and runs mainly on data center class accelerators. It is tuned for maximum quality and flexibility, with long sampling schedules and high VRAM requirements.\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] takes the same design direction and compresses it into smaller rectified flow transformers with 4 billion and 9 billion parameters. These models are distilled to very short sampling schedules, support the same text to image and multi reference editing tasks, and are optimized for response times below 1 second on modern GPUs. \n\n\n\nModel family and capabilities\n\n\n\nThe FLUX.2 [klein] family consists of 4 main open weight variants through a single architecture.\n\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] 4B\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] 9B\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] 4B Base\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] 9B Base\n\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] 4B and 9B are step distilled and guidance distilled models. They use 4 inference steps and are positioned as the fastest options for production and interactive workloads. FLUX.2 [klein] 9B combines a 9B flow model with an 8B Qwen3 text embedder and is described as the flagship small model on the Pareto frontier for quality versus latency across text to image, single reference editing, and multi reference generation.\n\n\n\nThe Base variants are undistilled versions with longer sampling schedules. The documentation lists them as foundation models that preserve the complete training signal and provide higher output diversity. They are intended for fine tuning, LoRA training, research pipelines, and custom post training workflows where control is more important than minimum latency. \n\n\n\nAll FLUX.2 [klein] models support three core tasks in the same architecture. They can generate images from text, they can edit a single input image, and they can perform multi reference generation and editing where several input images and a prompt jointly define the target output. \n\n\n\nLatency, VRAM, and quantized variants\n\n\n\nThe FLUX.2 [klein] model page provides approximate end to end inference times on GB200 and RTX 5090. FLUX.2 [klein] 4B is the fastest variant and is listed at about 0.3 to 1.2 seconds per image, depending on hardware. FLUX.2 [klein] 9B targets about 0.5 to 2 seconds at higher quality. The Base models require several seconds because they run with 50 step sampling schedules, but they expose more flexibility for custom pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe FLUX.2 [klein] 4B model card states that 4B fits in about 13 GB of VRAM and is suitable for GPUs like the RTX 3090 and RTX 4070. The FLUX.2 [klein] 9B card reports a requirement of about 29 GB of VRAM and targets hardware such as the RTX 4090. This means a single high end consumer card can host the distilled variants with full resolution sampling.\n\n\n\nTo extend the reach to more devices, Black Forest Labs also releases FP8 and NVFP4 versions for all FLUX.2 [klein] variants, developed together with NVIDIA. FP8 quantization is described as up to 1.6 times faster with up to 40 percent lower VRAM usage, and NVFP4 as up to 2.7 times faster with up to 55 percent lower VRAM usage on RTX GPUs, while keeping the core capabilities the same.\n\n\n\nBenchmarks against other image models\n\n\n\nBlack Forest Labs evaluates FLUX.2 [klein] through Elo style comparisons on text to image, single reference editing, and multi reference tasks. The performance charts show FLUX.2 [klein] on the Pareto frontier of Elo score versus latency and Elo score versus VRAM.The commentary states that FLUX.2 [klein] matches or exceeds the quality of Qwen based image models at a fraction of the latency and VRAM, and that it outperforms Z Image while supporting unified text to image and multi reference editing in one architecture.\n\n\n\nhttps://bfl.ai/blog/flux2-klein-towards-interactive-visual-intelligence\n\n\nThe base variants trade some speed for full customizability and fine tuning, which aligns with their role as foundation checkpoints for new research and domain specific pipelines.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nFLUX.2 [klein] is a compact rectified flow transformer family with 4B and 9B variants that supports text to image, single image editing, and multi reference generation in one unified architecture.\n\n\n\nThe distilled FLUX.2 [klein] 4B and 9B models use 4 sampling steps and are optimized for sub second inference on a single modern GPU, while the undistilled Base models use longer schedules and are intended for fine tuning and research.\n\n\n\nQuantized FP8 and NVFP4 variants, built with NVIDIA, provide up to 1.6 times speedup with about 40 percent VRAM reduction for FP8 and up to 2.7 times speedup with about 55 percent VRAM reduction for NVFP4 on RTX GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Technical details, Repo and Model weights. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content_html": "<p>Black Forest Labs releases FLUX.2 [klein], a compact image model family that targets interactive visual intelligence on consumer hardware. FLUX.2 [klein] extends the FLUX.2 line with sub second generation and editing, a unified architecture for text to image and image to image, and deployment options that range from local GPUs to cloud APIs, while keeping state of the art image quality.</p>\n<p>From FLUX.2 [dev] to interactive visual intelligence</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [dev] is a 32 billion parameter rectified flow transformer for text conditioned image generation and editing, including composition with multiple reference images, and runs mainly on data center class accelerators. It is tuned for maximum quality and flexibility, with long sampling schedules and high VRAM requirements.</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] takes the same design direction and compresses it into smaller rectified flow transformers with 4 billion and 9 billion parameters. These models are distilled to very short sampling schedules, support the same text to image and multi reference editing tasks, and are optimized for response times below 1 second on modern GPUs.</p>\n<p>Model family and capabilities</p>\n<p>The FLUX.2 [klein] family consists of 4 main open weight variants through a single architecture.</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] 4B</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] 9B</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] 4B Base</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] 9B Base</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] 4B and 9B are step distilled and guidance distilled models. They use 4 inference steps and are positioned as the fastest options for production and interactive workloads. FLUX.2 [klein] 9B combines a 9B flow model with an 8B Qwen3 text embedder and is described as the flagship small model on the Pareto frontier for quality versus latency across text to image, single reference editing, and multi reference generation.</p>\n<p>The Base variants are undistilled versions with longer sampling schedules. The documentation lists them as foundation models that preserve the complete training signal and provide higher output diversity. They are intended for fine tuning, LoRA training, research pipelines, and custom post training workflows where control is more important than minimum latency.</p>\n<p>All FLUX.2 [klein] models support three core tasks in the same architecture. They can generate images from text, they can edit a single input image, and they can perform multi reference generation and editing where several input images and a prompt jointly define the target output.</p>\n<p>Latency, VRAM, and quantized variants</p>\n<p>The FLUX.2 [klein] model page provides approximate end to end inference times on GB200 and RTX 5090. FLUX.2 [klein] 4B is the fastest variant and is listed at about 0.3 to 1.2 seconds per image, depending on hardware. FLUX.2 [klein] 9B targets about 0.5 to 2 seconds at higher quality. The Base models require several seconds because they run with 50 step sampling schedules, but they expose more flexibility for custom pipelines.</p>\n<p>The FLUX.2 [klein] 4B model card states that 4B fits in about 13 GB of VRAM and is suitable for GPUs like the RTX 3090 and RTX 4070. The FLUX.2 [klein] 9B card reports a requirement of about 29 GB of VRAM and targets hardware such as the RTX 4090. This means a single high end consumer card can host the distilled variants with full resolution sampling.</p>\n<p>To extend the reach to more devices, Black Forest Labs also releases FP8 and NVFP4 versions for all FLUX.2 [klein] variants, developed together with NVIDIA. FP8 quantization is described as up to 1.6 times faster with up to 40 percent lower VRAM usage, and NVFP4 as up to 2.7 times faster with up to 55 percent lower VRAM usage on RTX GPUs, while keeping the core capabilities the same.</p>\n<p>Benchmarks against other image models</p>\n<p>Black Forest Labs evaluates FLUX.2 [klein] through Elo style comparisons on text to image, single reference editing, and multi reference tasks. The performance charts show FLUX.2 [klein] on the Pareto frontier of Elo score versus latency and Elo score versus VRAM.The commentary states that FLUX.2 [klein] matches or exceeds the quality of Qwen based image models at a fraction of the latency and VRAM, and that it outperforms Z Image while supporting unified text to image and multi reference editing in one architecture.</p>\n<p>https://bfl.ai/blog/flux2-klein-towards-interactive-visual-intelligence</p>\n<p>The base variants trade some speed for full customizability and fine tuning, which aligns with their role as foundation checkpoints for new research and domain specific pipelines.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>FLUX.2 [klein] is a compact rectified flow transformer family with 4B and 9B variants that supports text to image, single image editing, and multi reference generation in one unified architecture.</p>\n<p>The distilled FLUX.2 [klein] 4B and 9B models use 4 sampling steps and are optimized for sub second inference on a single modern GPU, while the undistilled Base models use longer schedules and are intended for fine tuning and research.</p>\n<p>Quantized FP8 and NVFP4 variants, built with NVIDIA, provide up to 1.6 times speedup with about 40 percent VRAM reduction for FP8 and up to 2.7 times speedup with about 55 percent VRAM reduction for NVFP4 on RTX GPUs.</p>\n<p>Check out the&nbsp;Technical details, Repo and Model weights.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.

      "title": "Listen Labs raises $69M after viral billboard hiring stunt to scale AI customer interviews",
      "content": "Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.&quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&quot;Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix itListen&#x27;s AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: &quot;Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can&#x27;t get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.&quot; The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, &quot;gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they&#x27;re talking about. And the problem is you can&#x27;t scale that.&quot;The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.What distinguishes Listen&#x27;s approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. &quot;In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,&quot; Wahlforss said. &quot;Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.&quot;The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraudListen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called &quot;one of the most shocking things that we&#x27;ve learned when we entered this industry&quot;—rampant fraud.&quot;Essentially, there&#x27;s a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,&quot; he explained. &quot;We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.&quot;The company built what it calls a &quot;quality guard&quot; that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: &quot;People talk three times more. They&#x27;re much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.&quot;Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. &quot;We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,&quot; said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better productsThe speed advantage has proven central to Listen&#x27;s pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. &quot;By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,&quot; said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. &quot;We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,&quot; Patel said, &quot;and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.&quot; Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. &quot;We went from &#x27;Should we even have this product?&#x27; to &#x27;How should we launch it?&#x27;&quot; said Chris Hoyle, the company&#x27;s Chief Marketing Officer.Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. &quot;There&#x27;s school, sports, dinner, and homework,&quot; explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. &quot;I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules.&quot;The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI &quot;through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed.&quot; The redesigned product became &quot;a blockbuster hit.&quot;The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not lessListen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.&quot;There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing,&quot; Wahlforss said. &quot;Why we&#x27;re replacing them is that one, they&#x27;re super costly. Two, they&#x27;re kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with.&quot;But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn&#x27;t just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.&quot;What I&#x27;ve noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don&#x27;t need less of it. You want more of it,&quot; Wahlforss explained. &quot;There&#x27;s infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren&#x27;t researchers before can now do that as part of their job.&quot;Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toiletListen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. &quot;We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day,&quot; Wahlforss recalled. &quot;We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today.&quot;The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss&#x27;s co-founder &quot;was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.&quot; The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.&quot;We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,&quot; he said. &quot;But now we fixed that situation.&quot;The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building nextWahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building &quot;the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we&#x27;ve done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.&quot;Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. &quot;Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?&quot;Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. &quot;Obviously, as you said, there&#x27;s kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.&quot;The company already handles sensitive data with care. &quot;We don&#x27;t train on any of the data,&quot; Wahlforss said. &quot;We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that.&quot;How AI could reshape the future of product developmentPerhaps the most provocative implication of Listen&#x27;s model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.&quot;They&#x27;re based in Australia, so they&#x27;re coding during the day, and then in their night, they&#x27;re releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate.&quot;The vision extends Y Combinator&#x27;s famous dictum — &quot;write code, talk to users&quot; — into an automated cycle. &quot;Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you&#x27;ll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously.&quot;Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen&#x27;s control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.&quot;I&#x27;m constantly have to emphasize like, let&#x27;s make sure the quality is there and the details are right,&quot; he said.But the company&#x27;s growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft&#x27;s Patel said Listen has &quot;removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work.&quot; Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.&quot;It&#x27;s a total game changer,&quot; said Ali Romero, Sling Money&#x27;s marketing manager.Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he&#x27;s building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.One of them: &quot;Slow is fake.&quot;It&#x27;s an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.",

      "title": "AI is Forcing the End of Unit Testing. Here’s What It Means for Engineering Talent",
      "content": "\nAI is fundamentally rewriting age-old codes and reshaping how systems are designed, tested, and trusted. At a massive scale, traditional engineering assumptions are breaking down, and nowhere is this more evident than in testing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n​​Writing unit tests has increasingly been delegated to AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, offering developers a much-needed sense of respite by reducing repetitive effort and speeding up test creation.\n\n\n\nThis shift is structural, and it has sweeping implications for engineering talent, infrastructure design, and how the next generation of technologists must be trained.\n\n\n\nVenkat Pullela, CTO, networking at Keysight Technologies, mentions in a conversation with AIM, “With AI, people are forced to do system testing. You cannot do unit testing anymore.”\n\n\n\nHowever, the larger question is why unit testing is no longer enough.\n\n\n\nFor decades, engineering excellence was measured by how well individual components performed in isolation. Unit testing became the gold standard. But AI systems, especially those running on thousands or even millions of GPUs, do not fail that way.\n\n\n\n“The failures at a system level are fundamentally different,” Pullela explains. “And people are finding failures that are unique and different.”\n\n\n\nIn fact, “during interviews, candidates with an existing code block and ask them to explain its time and space complexity, evaluate trade-offs, and propose alternative approaches. Rather than testing how fast they can write code, we focus on how deeply they can reason, analyse, and think critically about it,” founder and CEO of a software technology company tells AIM.\n\n\n\nIn hyperscale AI environments, even a minor anomaly can cascade across the entire system. “When you have a million GPUs, even if one GPU runs at half speed, all the million minus one also is as if they are running at half speed because of it.”\n\n\n\nThe cost of such failures is enormous. It forces teams to rethink how early and how holistically they test.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most radical change is when testing now begins. Engineers are being asked to validate entire systems before hardware even exists.\n\n\n\n“You don’t even have an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit),” Pullela notes. “You have a design of an ASIC—and you have to do system testing.”\n\n\n\nTo make this possible, companies are blending simulation, emulation, and real components into what is often loosely called a ‘digital twin’. But the intent is precise: bringing system-level behaviour forward in time.\n\n\n\n“We are combining simulation, emulation and real components and building a system,” he says. “You are bringing the system to you while you don’t have anything—you just have ideas.”\n\n\n\nThis shift-left approach is dramatically compressing development cycles, uncovering failures earlier, and fundamentally changing how products reach production.\n\n\n\nThis transformation is not happening in silos. Vendors, cloud giants, and infrastructure providers are now tightly coupled in co-design relationships.\n\n\n\nHyperscalers have become lighthouse customers, shaping architectures, testing methodologies, and tooling alongside their partners. Massive-scale simulation environments, such as containerised networks that mirror real-world deployments, are now standard practice before a single line of production code is released.\n\n\n\nThe Other Side&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Indian IT Sector’s testing and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function currently has over 3.75 lakh active professionals across different experience ranges as of April 30, 2025, according to Xpheno data.\n\n\n\nThe talent pool’s churn, often seen as an indicator of active hiring activity, has been in the average range of 7-9%.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Reddit discussion thread reflects widespread scepticism within the QA community about claims that AI can fully automate end-to-end testing or replace QA roles in the near future. While AI is increasingly being adopted as a productivity booster, most practitioners see it as an assistive tool rather than a substitute for human judgement.\n\n\n\nSeveral experienced QA professionals and Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) noted that, despite heavy marketing, no AI-powered testing tools today can independently design, execute, and maintain meaningful end-to-end tests at scale without significant human guidance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAI performs reasonably well in limited areas such as generating helper functions, writing boilerplate test code, parsing unfamiliar codebases, creating mock data, or assisting with debugging. However, when tests involve complex workflows, business logic, domain-specific edge cases, or evolving product behaviour, AI’s effectiveness drops sharply.\n\n\n\nAttempts to fully automate testing by simply pointing AI tools at an application often yield brittle, low-quality tests unless a skilled QA professional actively directs the process.

      "content_html": "<p>AI is fundamentally rewriting age-old codes and reshaping how systems are designed, tested, and trusted. At a massive scale, traditional engineering assumptions are breaking down, and nowhere is this more evident than in testing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>​​Writing unit tests has increasingly been delegated to AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, offering developers a much-needed sense of respite by reducing repetitive effort and speeding up test creation.</p>\n<p>This shift is structural, and it has sweeping implications for engineering talent, infrastructure design, and how the next generation of technologists must be trained.</p>\n<p>Venkat Pullela, CTO, networking at Keysight Technologies, mentions in a conversation with AIM, “With AI, people are forced to do system testing. You cannot do unit testing anymore.”</p>\n<p>However, the larger question is why unit testing is no longer enough.</p>\n<p>For decades, engineering excellence was measured by how well individual components performed in isolation. Unit testing became the gold standard. But AI systems, especially those running on thousands or even millions of GPUs, do not fail that way.</p>\n<p>“The failures at a system level are fundamentally different,” Pullela explains. “And people are finding failures that are unique and different.”</p>\n<p>In fact, “during interviews, candidates with an existing code block and ask them to explain its time and space complexity, evaluate trade-offs, and propose alternative approaches. Rather than testing how fast they can write code, we focus on how deeply they can reason, analyse, and think critically about it,” founder and CEO of a software technology company tells AIM.</p>\n<p>In hyperscale AI environments, even a minor anomaly can cascade across the entire system. “When you have a million GPUs, even if one GPU runs at half speed, all the million minus one also is as if they are running at half speed because of it.”</p>\n<p>The cost of such failures is enormous. It forces teams to rethink how early and how holistically they test.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most radical change is when testing now begins. Engineers are being asked to validate entire systems before hardware even exists.</p>\n<p>“You don’t even have an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit),” Pullela notes. “You have a design of an ASIC—and you have to do system testing.”</p>\n<p>To make this possible, companies are blending simulation, emulation, and real components into what is often loosely called a ‘digital twin’. But the intent is precise: bringing system-level behaviour forward in time.</p>\n<p>“We are combining simulation, emulation and real components and building a system,” he says. “You are bringing the system to you while you don’t have anything—you just have ideas.”</p>\n<p>This shift-left approach is dramatically compressing development cycles, uncovering failures earlier, and fundamentally changing how products reach production.</p>\n<p>This transformation is not happening in silos. Vendors, cloud giants, and infrastructure providers are now tightly coupled in co-design relationships.</p>\n<p>Hyperscalers have become lighthouse customers, shaping architectures, testing methodologies, and tooling alongside their partners. Massive-scale simulation environments, such as containerised networks that mirror real-world deployments, are now standard practice before a single line of production code is released.</p>\n<p>The Other Side&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Indian IT Sector’s testing and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function currently has over 3.75 lakh active professionals across different experience ranges as of April 30, 2025, according to Xpheno data.</p>\n<p>The talent pool’s churn, often seen as an indicator of active hiring activity, has been in the average range of 7-9%.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a Reddit discussion thread reflects widespread scepticism within the QA community about claims that AI can fully automate end-to-end testing or replace QA roles in the near future. While AI is increasingly being adopted as a productivity booster, most practitioners see it as an assistive tool rather than a substitute for human judgement.</p>\n<p>Several experienced QA professionals and Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) noted that, despite heavy marketing, no AI-powered testing tools today can independently design, execute, and maintain meaningful end-to-end tests at scale without significant human guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AI performs reasonably well in limited areas such as generating helper functions, writing boilerplate test code, parsing unfamiliar codebases, creating mock data, or assisting with debugging. However, when tests involve complex workflows, business logic, domain-specific edge cases, or evolving product behaviour, AI’s effectiveness drops sharply.</p>\n<p>Attempts to fully automate testing by simply pointing AI tools at an application often yield brittle, low-quality tests unless a skilled QA professional actively directs the process. Without human oversight, AI-generated tests are often deemed unreliable.</p>\n<p>Skills are Lagging the Pace of Change</p>\n<p>As systems grow more complex, the skills required to build and validate them are evolving faster than institutions can adapt.</p>\n<p>When systems become more complex and AI-generated code becomes more common, the need for professionals who can validate behaviour, assess risk, and understand system impact is expected to grow.</p>\n<p>Upskilling is widely encouraged, not as a way to escape QA, but to strengthen it.

      "content": "\nBig Tech has been openly and aggressively pushing countries to adopt artificial intelligence. In India alone, Microsoft has commited $17.5 billion to develop AI infrastructure over the next four years, while Amazon has one-upped the software giant with a $35-billion pledge for AI-driven digitisation and cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHowever, the rapid pace at which AI is being promoted has unsettled regulators and civil society groups, with some accusing Big Tech of only serving corporate interests and warning governments against deepening their dependence on the Global North.\n\n\n\nAt a recent public dialogue on The Evolving Politics of AI Governance, hosted in New Delhi by the embassies of France and the Netherlands, in collaboration with digital civil rights-focused non-profit Access Now, panellists noted Big Tech has been sidestepping the idea of putting checks and balances against AI in the race to be on top.\n\n\n\n“It’s a race everyone wants to win, regardless of what they actually want from the technology,” the panellists observed in the discussion held under the Chatham House Rules.\n\n\n\nThey flagged that India is being projected as the next major AI destination without sufficient consideration of local needs. “AI is not a magic solution to all problems. Healthcare apps won’t fix the fact that India spends less than 2% of its GDP on healthcare. We are also building data centres in drought-prone areas—are we not reinforcing dependence on the Global North?” they pondered.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Big Tech companies tend to avoid scrutiny and liability due to the “black box” nature of complex AI models and to protect IP amid competitive pressure. Recent incidents, such as xAI’s Grok AI chatbot generating sexualised deepfakes of women and SaaS company Workday facing a lawsuit for its AI hiring tools allegedly discriminating against certain demographics, have catapulted the issue.\n\n\n\nCalls for post-model testing, panellists noted, were increasingly framed as being anti-innovation. “We speak of AI sovereignty, yet quietly become dependent on Big Tech. Why is digital public infrastructure being rebranded? Why is deregulation central to Big Tech’s agenda? These questions must be answered before embracing AI wholesale,” the speakers noted.\n\n\n\nRegulations Haven’t Worked\n\n\n\nThe panellists argued that existing regulatory approaches have been insufficient.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Self-regulation has not worked in the tech sector and never will. For Big Tech, reputational harm matters more than social harm, and regulation must address that,” they said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoreover, AI monopolies pose risks to democracy and national security. According to a Trends Research &amp; Advisory study, the concentration of the AI value chain in the hands of a few Big Tech companies—Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta—has fostered vertical integration and network effects that restrict competition and limit bottom-up innovation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe panellists also raised concerns that industrial policy is not aligning with AI governance frameworks.\n\n\n\n“We do not want to repeat the mistakes made with social media 15 years ago, where the debate now centres on banning platforms. We should adopt AI and GenAI more cautiously and assess long-term consequences. Different stakeholders have different responsibilities, and they must act accordingly,” the speakers said.\n\n\n\nThe Way Forward\n\n\n\nPanellists called for non-monopolistic pathways for AI development to prevent Big Tech from continuing to act as kingmakers. Regulations, they argued, should focus on core technology infrastructure. Suggestions included breaking up cloud businesses, tightening scrutiny of acquisitions, and mandating detailed ‘bills of materials’ for AI systems, covering data sources, labour conditions, and legal frameworks.\n\n\n\nOn India’s role, speakers stressed the need for the country to emerge as a leader of the Global South through varied forms of cooperation—not just North–South, but also South–South, including partnerships with regions such as Africa. Expanding renewable energy use, they said, would be critical to offset the growing energy demands of data centres.\n\n\n\nThe panellists also urged greater transparency and substance from global AI summits. “Ethics, equity and ecology must be on the table. Industry should be left off it,” they said.\n\n\n\nThe event featured opening remarks by Anne Bouverot, France’s special envoy for AI and a concluding address by Damien Syed, deputy chief of mission at the French Embassy in New Delhi.

      "content_html": "<p>Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’Advances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.Patrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) jumped 40.1% year-on-year to ₹1,892 crore, while EBIT margin expanded to 13.1₹, reflecting better execution and cost discipline during the quarter.\n\n\n\nDeal momentum also remained strong.

      "title": "How to Build a Safe, Autonomous Prior Authorization Agent for Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management with Human-in-the-Loop Controls",
      "content": "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how an autonomous, agentic AI system can simulate the end-to-end prior authorization workflow within healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM). We show how an agent continuously monitors incoming surgery orders, gathers the required clinical documentation, submits prior authorization requests to payer systems, tracks their status, and intelligently responds to denials through automated analysis and appeals. We design the system to act conservatively and responsibly, escalating to a human reviewer when uncertainty crosses a defined threshold. While the implementation uses mocked EHR and payer portals for clarity and safety, we intentionally mirror real-world healthcare workflows to make the logic transferable to production environments. Also, we emphasize that it is strictly a technical simulation and not a substitute for clinical judgment, payer policy interpretation, or regulatory compliance.

We showed that combining deterministic policy logic, uncertainty estimation, and optional LLM-assisted reasoning enables a balanced approach that aligns with healthcare’s safety-critical nature. This work should be viewed as an architectural and educational reference rather than a deployable medical system; any real-world implementation must adhere to HIPAA and regional data protection laws, incorporate de-identification and access controls, undergo clinical and compliance review, and be validated against payer-specific policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the FULL CODES here. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content_html": "<p>In this tutorial, we demonstrate how an autonomous, agentic AI system can simulate the end-to-end prior authorization workflow within healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM). We show how an agent continuously monitors incoming surgery orders, gathers the required clinical documentation, submits prior authorization requests to payer systems, tracks their status, and intelligently responds to denials through automated analysis and appeals. We design the system to act conservatively and responsibly, escalating to a human reviewer when uncertainty crosses a defined threshold. While the implementation uses mocked EHR and payer portals for clarity and safety, we intentionally mirror real-world healthcare workflows to make the logic transferable to production environments. Also, we emphasize that it is strictly a technical simulation and not a substitute for clinical judgment, payer policy interpretation, or regulatory compliance.

We emphasize observability and traceability as essential requirements for healthcare AI systems.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we illustrated how agentic AI can meaningfully reduce administrative friction in healthcare RCM by automating repetitive, rules-driven prior authorization tasks while preserving human oversight for ambiguous or high-risk decisions. We showed that combining deterministic policy logic, uncertainty estimation, and optional LLM-assisted reasoning enables a balanced approach that aligns with healthcare’s safety-critical nature. This work should be viewed as an architectural and educational reference rather than a deployable medical system; any real-world implementation must adhere to HIPAA and regional data protection laws, incorporate de-identification and access controls, undergo clinical and compliance review, and be validated against payer-specific policies.</p>\n<p>Check out the&nbsp;FULL CODES here.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.
