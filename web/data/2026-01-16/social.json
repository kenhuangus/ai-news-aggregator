Said she was surprised the keyboard shortcuts were in Code terminal and Cowork but not Code desktop (and said \"could have just been what task I tested but I'm surprised I'm replying in text when it gave me a numbered list\"). Said the permission popups were annoying and stacked. Overall, she said she liked it enough that it made her dislike Cowork even more by comparison.</p>"
