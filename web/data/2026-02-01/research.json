      "content": "Assume we want to know the probability that two events co-occur (i.e. of their conjunction). If the two events are independent, the probability of the co-occurrence is the product of the probabilities of the individual events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).In order to estimate the probability of some event, one method would be to decompose that event into independent sub-events and use this method to estimate the probability. For example, if the target event E = A and B and C, then we can estimate P(E) as P(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C).Suppose we want to make an event seem unlikely. If we use the above method but slightly under-estimated the sub-event probabilities and use a large number of sub-events, then the resulting final probability will inevitably be very small.

      "content": "I’ve recently read the book Inventing Temperature, and very much enjoyed it. It’s a book that’s basically about the following problem: there was a time in which humans had not yet built accurate thermometers, and therefore weren’t able to scientifically investigate the phenomenon of temperature, which would require measuring it. But to build a thermometer and know you’ve done so correctly, it seems like you have to know that its temperature readings match the real temperature, which seemingly requires either other known-functional thermometers to calibrate (which they did not have), or a rigorous enough scientific understanding of temperature to know that your thermometer tracks it well (which is hard to obtain without having thermometers)—so it’s not obvious how one could go from a situation where thermometers didn’t exist to one where they do exist, and where we are justified in believing that they accurately measure temperature. This book has had some popularity in the rationality community as an account of applied epistemology, and in particular, for its description of how to measure something intangible. An obvious application of the book (which I won’t elaborate much on except in a footnote1) is in understanding artificial intelligence: there are various properties like the ‘capability’ or ‘alignment’ of AI models (or perhaps of models+scaffolds, or perhaps of ecosystems of models) which we would like to understand but for which we do not have good measures of, and it’s not straightforward to know how we can validate our measures. I had purchased it in November 2024, and was very slowly making my way thru it, until I joined METR (an organization for which these questions are especially salient) and ran an Inventing Temperature Book Club, thereby forcing myself to read it. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and would add my voice to the chorus of those recommending it to all those who want to know how to know things, as well as those with interest in the study of the...",
