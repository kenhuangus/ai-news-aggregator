After 30 million (20 hz) environment steps (17 days non stop) it mined a diamond. Unlike the Atari games, which are played with the same pixels and controls that a human uses, this is a modified interface with the inventory and stats presented directly to the model, and a categorical action space – no mousing around the inventory and crafting screens.\n\nMining had to be modified to instant-break instead of the normal multi-second hold of the mining button because Dreamer uses stochastic action policies, which are almost incapable of holding a button for hundreds of frames in a row. Similarly, the jump action required multiple frames of holding, so it was made instant.\nStill, it was the first time an RL agent had gotten this far without having used imitation learning from human players, and significant improvements were made on all the other benchmarks as well.\nThe improvements were largely engineering grinds, rather than completely different architectures.

The diagrams are improved.\n\nWith the jointly trained models, there is a tension between the representation model wanting to degenerate to make prediction easier and being useful for predicting following states. One of the tricks they use is “free bits”, clipping the losses when below a certain level so they don’t try to drive all the way to zero, allowing the opposing force to then make progress unopposed.\n\nFor the categorical distributions they use 1% label smoothing on the categorical distributions to avoid spikes in the KL loss. They call this “unimix” for mixing a uniform distribution on top of the existing distribution. Tthis is non-standard (versus label smoothing), but arguably better terminology.\n\nThey use a two-hot categorical value instead of MSE regression for the critic, but unlike most other implementations, use exponentially spaced bins instead of linearly spaced so they can cover several orders of magnitude. They define functions symlog() / symexp() to allow the networks to handle widely varying values in both positive and negative ranges. Reportedly works better than the similar non-linear transformation used in MuZero and Muesli.\n\nThis apparently required some care: “For computing the expected prediction of the softmax distribution under bins that span many orders of magnitude, the summation order matters and positive and negative bins should be summed up separately, from small to large bins, and then added.”\n\nThe final layer of the reward and critic models are zero-initialized instead of randomly initialized to avoid potentially large spurious values at the beginning of training.\n\nThe target model for the value function is now an EMA instead of a periodic copy.\n\nTo get the same amount of exploration from their policy gradient regardless of the scale of the value functions, they scale the (exponentially spaced, so potentially very large) returns to a bounded range, only considering the 5% to 95% range seen to exclude outliers.\n\nThey do 16 step prediction in imagination, but action selection in real environments is strictly by the policy model.

      "content": "I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from \"how is this interesting at all\" all the way to \"it's so over\".\n\nTo add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing. And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other. So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.\n\nThat said - we have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\n\nThis brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago\n\"The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope.\", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated \"skynet\" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.\n\nTLDR sure maybe I am \"overhyping\" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.",

      "content_html": "<p>I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from \"how is this interesting at all\" all the way to \"it's so over\".</p>\n<p>To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing. And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other. So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.</p>\n<p>That said - we have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.</p>\n<p>This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago</p>\n<p>\"The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope.\", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated \"skynet\" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.</p>\n<p>TLDR sure maybe I am \"overhyping\" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.</p>"
