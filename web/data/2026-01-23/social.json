      "content": "#PaperADay 9\nfloq: Training Critics via Flow-Matching for Scaling Compute in Value-Based RL\nhttps://t.co/V4kCMfUkEK\n\nIn theory, value based reinforcement learning is a regression problem, which is most naturally addressed with an MSE loss. However, there are a bunch of subtle reasons why a neural network terminating in a single activation may not be an ideal value function approximator.\n\nMost models today use a categorical value representation to mitigate some of the training issues, but the proposal here is to generate the categorical value with around 8 steps of a flow model, which plausibly makes it easier to represent complex mappings.\n\nThis kind of refinement-from-noise is appealing to me as a possible way to be sort of “error correcting” and combat the problem of catastrophic forgetting. If you learn something well, then train on something else for a few million optimizer steps, the odds are good that your original task performance will be almost back to random if you try it again. Hints of the original behavior remain, but covered in a lot of noise. Some kind of de-noising on the values would be a big help.\n\nI’m not familiar with the benchmarks they use, but they appear to be comparing with a previous model, which may not be State Of The Art, and there is also some per-environment hyperparameter tuning. They target offline RL, optionally followed by a period of online fine-tuning, so there may be issues with the learning dynamics when going completely from scratch.\n\nTheir flow model is a 4-layer MLP, and I’m guessing they have a modestly sized explicit state. I’m not sure what the training dynamics would be if you had to co-learn a CNN feature extractor with the flow model.\n\nThey compare the flow model against both an 8x ensemble of value functions (going wide) and a ResNet with 8x the layers (going deep) and find that the flow model is notably superior.\n\nThe details of the ensemble could be important – an ensemble of models trained on the same sequence of samples doesn’t help much in RL, but an ensemble trained with completely different IID samples can make a difference.\n\nOne of the key points about flow models is that they get supervision at every step, unlike a very deep traditional model that only gets supervision at the very end, which is backpropagated through all the layers. I wonder if you could train the deeper res-net with similar supervision at multiple interior points.\n\nThey presume to know ahead of time what the range of possible Q values are to set the range of the initial input noise, and it is a sensitive parameter on some of the benchmarks, which could be problematic.\n\nBroad categorical value representation was essential; doing flow based on a scalar worked poorly.\n\nThe time input to the velocity network is a multi-channel fourier basis, using a scalar time also worked poorly.\n\nI have been meaning to learn more about flow models, this has been a good prod.",

Hints of the original behavior remain, but covered in a lot of noise. Some kind of de-noising on the values would be a big help.</p>\n<p>I’m not familiar with the benchmarks they use, but they appear to be comparing with a previous model, which may not be State Of The Art, and there is also some per-environment hyperparameter tuning. They target offline RL, optionally followed by a period of online fine-tuning, so there may be issues with the learning dynamics when going completely from scratch.</p>\n<p>Their flow model is a 4-layer MLP, and I’m guessing they have a modestly sized explicit state. I’m not sure what the training dynamics would be if you had to co-learn a CNN feature extractor with the flow model.</p>\n<p>They compare the flow model against both an 8x ensemble of value functions (going wide) and a ResNet with 8x the layers (going deep) and find that the flow model is notably superior.</p>\n<p>The details of the ensemble could be important – an ensemble of models trained on the same sequence of samples doesn’t help much in RL, but an ensemble trained with completely different IID samples can make a difference.</p>\n<p>One of the key points about flow models is that they get supervision at every step, unlike a very deep traditional model that only gets supervision at the very end, which is backpropagated through all the layers. I wonder if you could train the deeper res-net with similar supervision at multiple interior points.</p>\n<p>They presume to know ahead of time what the range of possible Q values are to set the range of the initial input noise, and it is a sensitive parameter on some of the benchmarks, which could be problematic.</p>\n<p>Broad categorical value representation was essential; doing flow based on a scalar worked poorly.</p>\n<p>The time input to the velocity network is a multi-channel fourier basis, using a scalar time also worked poorly.</p>\n<p>I have been meaning to learn more about flow models, this has been a good prod.</p>"

His statements this morning remind me of 2018 when he said autonomous vehicles are just around the corner. Now eight years later that statement is coming true. I bought it knowing that it would take years (spent $6,000 on FSD way back then, and am happy I did so, my robot has driven me all over America).\n\nThe cynics will look at cost and say \"no way will he sell millions of robots.\" The typical American home doesn't have any device in it that costs more than $2,000. \n\nWhich gets me back to how do you reduce the cost to that level?\n\nRent it. \n\nMost American homes don't actually have that much work for a robot. For the last eight years I've been running my household with now teenage kids at home. The unenjoyable part of home life is stuff like laundry. Now that my kids are teenagers they are like cheap robots, we have them doing chores like dishes and laundry.\n\nI'm still convinced the first 20 million won't be bought by home owners anyway.

But it still would be unused for many hours in a day. \n\nWhat if it could be rented to my neighbors to do simple tasks for them too? \n\nThen the cost comes down quite a bit. A $20,000 robot that just does laundry could serve two homes a day. That's 14 homes. \n\nIt still is fairly expensive.

Maybe.\n\nBut this is why I am studying people with bad knees. \n\nThey have a completely different value proposition than typical parents who are working in some executive job.

And safe to become a mainstream product that even more than five percent of homes own.\n\nI doubt that the average home will have one before 2035, but if you have parents with bad knees, or a business owner who can't get enough good help to do some menial tasks in a machine shop, or working at, say, a laundromat or other business?

Which is what Elon has been doing for years. Remember the dancing human dressed up as a humanoid?\n\nI find the robot industry so interesting because it is so hard to introduce a major new product to people who don't already own such a product. \n\nAnd this one is one of the most complex products ever developed by human beings. \n\nThat said, I love the dream, and certainly will be amongst those that talk about it, and other companies (I have a list here on X of all of them), that bring interesting new robots out to people.\n\nNow back to other innovation, later today will have a video of an entrepreneur that's using blockchain technologies to bring a new kind of AI-first store to all of us.",

That is even true for Elon, who has a half dozen factories that make things.</p>\n<p>Early customers are key to getting manufacturing up to scale, I learned.</p>\n<p>And finding early customers is all about putting a dream out there. Which is what Elon has been doing for years. Remember the dancing human dressed up as a humanoid?</p>\n<p>I find the robot industry so interesting because it is so hard to introduce a major new product to people who don't already own such a product.</p>\n<p>And this one is one of the most complex products ever developed by human beings.</p>\n<p>That said, I love the dream, and certainly will be amongst those that talk about it, and other companies (I have a list here on X of all of them), that bring interesting new robots out to people.</p>\n<p>Now back to other innovation, later today will have a video of an entrepreneur that's using blockchain technologies to bring a new kind of AI-first store to all of us.</p>"
