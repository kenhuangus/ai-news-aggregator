      "title": "Microsoft Releases VibeVoice-ASR: A Unified Speech-to-Text Model Designed to Handle 60-Minute Long-Form Audio in a Single Pass",
      "content": "Microsoft has released VibeVoice-ASR as part of the VibeVoice family of open source frontier voice AI models. VibeVoice-ASR is described as a unified speech-to-text model that can handle 60-minute long-form audio in a single pass and output structured transcriptions that encode Who, When, and What, with support for Customized Hotwords.\n\n\n\nVibeVoice sits in a single repository that hosts Text-to-Speech, real time TTS, and Automatic Speech Recognition models under an MIT license. VibeVoice uses continuous speech tokenizers that run at 7.5 Hz and a next-token diffusion framework where a Large Language Model reasons over text and dialogue and a diffusion head generates acoustic detail. This framework is mainly documented for TTS, but it defines the overall design context in which VibeVoice-ASR lives.\n\n\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR\n\n\nLong form ASR with a single global context\n\n\n\nUnlike conventional ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems that first cut audio into short segments and then run diarization and alignment as separate components, VibeVoice-ASR is designed to accept up to 60 minutes of continuous audio input within a 64K token length budget. The model keeps one global representation of the full session. This means the model can maintain speaker identity and topic context across the entire hour instead of resetting every few seconds.\n\n\n\n60-minute Single-Pass Processing\n\n\n\nThe first key feature is that many conventional ASR systems process long audio by cutting it into short segments, which can lose global context. VibeVoice-ASR instead takes up to 60 minutes of continuous audio within a 64K token window so it can maintain consistent speaker tracking and semantic context across the entire recording.\n\n\n\nThis is important for tasks like meeting transcription, lectures, and long support calls. A single pass over the complete sequence simplifies the pipeline. There is no need to implement custom logic to merge partial hypotheses or repair speaker labels at boundaries between audio chunks.\n\n\n\nCustomized Hotwords for domain accuracy\n\n\n\nCustomized Hotwords are the second key feature. Users can provide hotwords such as product names, organization names, technical terms, or background context. The model uses these hotwords to guide the recognition process.\n\n\n\nThis allows you to bias decoding toward the correct spelling and pronunciation for domain specific tokens without retraining the model. For example, a dev-user can pass internal project names or customer specific terms at inference time. This is useful when deploying the same base model across several products that share similar acoustic conditions but very different vocabularies.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft also ships a finetuning-asr directory with LoRA based fine tuning scripts for VibeVoice-ASR. Together, hotwords and LoRA fine tuning give a path for both light weight adaptation and deeper domain specialization.\n\n\n\nRich Transcription, diarization, and timing\n\n\n\nThe third feature is Rich Transcription with Who, When, and What. The model jointly performs ASR, diarization, and timestamping, and returns a structured output that indicates who said what and when. \n\n\n\nSee below the three evaluation figures named DER, cpWER, and tcpWER.\n\n\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR\n\n\n\nDER is Diarization Error Rate, it measures how well the model assigns speech segments to the correct speaker\n\n\n\ncpWER and tcpWER are word error rate metrics computed under conversational settings\n\n\n\n\nThese graphs summarize how well the model performs on multi speaker long form data, which is the primary target setting for this ASR system.\n\n\n\nThe structured output format is well suited for downstream processing like speaker specific summarization, action item extraction, or analytics dashboards. Since segments, speakers, and timestamps already come from a single model, downstream code can treat the transcript as a time aligned event log.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nVibeVoice-ASR is a unified speech to text model that handles 60 minute long form audio in a single pass within a 64K token context.\n\n\n\nThe model jointly performs ASR, diarization, and timestamping so it outputs structured transcripts that encode Who, When, and What in a single inference step.\n\n\n\nCustomized Hotwords let users inject domain specific terms such as product names or technical jargon to improve recognition accuracy without retraining the model.\n\n\n\nEvaluation with DER, cpWER, and tcpWER focuses on multi speaker conversational scenarios which aligns the model with meetings, lectures, and long calls.\n\n\n\nVibeVoice-ASR is released in the VibeVoice open source stack under MIT license with official weights, fine tuning scripts, and an online Playground for experimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the&nbsp;Model Weights,&nbsp;Repo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Playground.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.

      "title": "Railway secures $100 million to challenge AWS with AI-native cloud infrastructure",
      "content": "Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.&quot;As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?&quot; said Jake Cooper, Railway&#x27;s 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can&#x27;t keep up.&quot;The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistantsRailway&#x27;s pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.&quot;When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks,&quot; Cooper told VentureBeat. &quot;What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents.&quot;The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.&quot;The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day,&quot; Lobaton said. &quot;If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes.&quot;Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratchWhat distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: &quot;People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.&quot;&quot;We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at &#x27;agentic speed&#x27; while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town.&quot;The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.&quot;The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing,&quot; Cooper noted. &quot;But when they&#x27;re charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we&#x27;ve purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity.&quot;How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenueRailway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. &quot;We&#x27;re default alive; there&#x27;s no reason for us to raise money,&quot; he said. &quot;We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive.&quot;The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway&#x27;s two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.&quot;We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come,&quot; Cooper recalled. &quot;And to some degree, they came.&quot;From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway&#x27;s unlikely corporate expansionDespite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit&#x27;s GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor&#x27;s Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.&quot;At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS,&quot; said Rafael Garcia, Kernel&#x27;s chief technology officer. &quot;Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012.&quot;For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer&#x27;s existing cloud environment through a &quot;bring your own cloud&quot; configuration.Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).The startup&#x27;s bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivalsRailway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.Cooper argues that Railway&#x27;s competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.&quot;The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven&#x27;t gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money,&quot; he observed. &quot;They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don&#x27;t really need to?&quot;Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. &quot;We&#x27;re not just containers; we&#x27;ve got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster.&quot;The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists todayRailway&#x27;s fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.&quot;The amount of software that&#x27;s going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we&#x27;re talking a thousand times more software,&quot; Cooper predicted. &quot;All of that has to run somewhere.&quot;The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls &quot;loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically.&quot; Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.&quot;The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity.&quot;What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experienceRailway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company&#x27;s five-year history.&quot;One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business,&quot; Cooper explained. &quot;We&#x27;ve built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what&#x27;s been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage.&quot;The company&#x27;s investor roster reads like a who&#x27;s who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.The timing of Railway&#x27;s expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper&#x27;s telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.&quot;In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period,&quot; he said. &quot;Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That&#x27;s the prize worth playing for, and there&#x27;s no bigger one on offer.&quot;For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.",

Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.\"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come,\" Cooper recalled. \"And to some degree, they came.\"From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansionDespite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.\"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS,\" said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. \"Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012.\"For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a \"bring your own cloud\" configuration.Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivalsRailway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.\"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money,\" he observed. \"They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?\"Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. \"We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing,\" Cooper said. \"And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster.\"The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists todayRailway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.\"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software,\" Cooper predicted. \"All of that has to run somewhere.\"The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls \"loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically.\" Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.\"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes,\" Cooper said. \"You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity.\"What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experienceRailway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.\"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business,\" Cooper explained. \"We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage.\"The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.\"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period,\" he said. \"Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer.\"For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.</p>"

      "title": "Gates Foundation and OpenAI test AI in African healthcare",
      "content": "Primary healthcare systems across parts of Africa are under growing strain, caught between rising demand, chronic staff shortages, and shrinking international aid budgets. In that context, AI is being tested in healthcare less as a breakthrough technology and more as a way to keep basic services running.\n\n\n\nAccording to reporting by Reuters, the Gates Foundation and OpenAI are backing a new initiative, Horizon1000, that aims to introduce AI tools into primary healthcare clinics across several African countries. The project will begin in Rwanda and is intended to reach 1,000 clinics and surrounding communities by 2028, supported by a combined $50 million investment.\n\n\n\nThe timing is not accidental as global development assistance for health fell by just under 27% last year compared to 2024, the Gates Foundation estimates, following cuts that began in the United States and spread to other major donors such as Britain and Germany. Those reductions have coincided with the first rise in preventable child deaths this century, adding pressure to health systems already stretched thin.\n\n\n\nRather than focusing on advanced diagnostics or research, Horizon1000 is framed around everyday tasks that consume time in under-resourced clinics. AI tools under the programme are expected to assist with patient intake, triage, record keeping, appointment scheduling, and access to medical guidance, particularly in settings where one doctor may serve tens of thousands of people.\n\n\n\nGates Foundation and OpenAI focus on AI support in healthcare\n\n\n\n“In poorer countries with enormous health worker shortages and lack of health systems infrastructure, AI can be a gamechanger in expanding access to quality care,” Bill Gates wrote in a blog post announcing the initiative. Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gates said the technology could help health systems recover after aid cuts slowed progress.\n\n\n\n“Our commitment is that that revolution will at least happen in the poor countries as quickly as it happens in the rich countries,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe focus, according to both partners, is on supporting healthcare workers rather than replacing them. OpenAI is expected to provide technical expertise and AI systems, while the Gates Foundation will work with African governments and health authorities to oversee deployment and alignment with national guidelines.\n\n\n\nRwanda was chosen as the first pilot country in part because of its existing digital health efforts. The country established an AI health hub in Kigali last year and has positioned itself as a testbed for health technology projects. Paula Ingabire, Rwanda’s minister of information and communications technology and innovation, said the goal is to reduce administrative burdens while expanding access.\n\n\n\n“It is about using AI responsibly to reduce the burden on healthcare workers, to improve the quality of care, and to reach more patients,” Ingabire said in a video statement released alongside the launch.\n\n\n\nUnder Horizon1000, AI tools may also be used before patients reach clinics. Gates told Reuters the systems could support pregnant women and HIV patients with guidance ahead of visits, especially when language barriers exist between patients and providers.\n\n\n\nWhat the AI tools are expected to handle\n\n\n\nOnce patients arrive, AI could help link records, reduce paperwork, and speed up routine processes.\n\n\n\n“A typical visit, we think, can be about twice as fast and much better quality,” Gates said.\n\n\n\nThose expectations highlight both the promise and the limits of the approach. While AI may help streamline workflows, its impact depends on reliable data, stable power and connectivity, trained staff, and clear oversight. Many previous digital health pilots in low-income settings have struggled to scale beyond initial trials once funding or external support tapered off.\n\n\n\nHorizon1000’s designers say they are trying to avoid that pattern by working closely with local governments and health leaders rather than deploying one-size-fits-all systems. Tools are meant to be adapted to local clinical rules, languages, and care models. Even so, questions remain about long-term maintenance, data governance, and who bears responsibility if systems fail or produce errors.\n\n\n\nThe initiative also reflects a broader shift in how AI is being positioned in global health. Instead of headline-grabbing claims about medical breakthroughs, the emphasis here is on narrow, operational use cases that address staffing gaps and administrative overload. In that sense, AI is being treated less as a cure for weak health systems and more as a temporary support amid declining resources.\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s involvement comes as the company expands its presence in healthcare, following earlier work on health-related applications. At the same time, it faces growing scrutiny over how its systems are trained, deployed, and governed, especially in sensitive sectors like medicine.\n\n\n\nA test of AI’s limits in healthcare systems\n\n\n\nFor African health systems, the stakes are practical rather than symbolic. Sub-Saharan Africa faces an estimated shortage of nearly six million healthcare workers, a gap that training alone cannot close in the near term. If AI tools can help clinicians see more patients, reduce errors, or manage workloads more effectively, they may offer some relief. If they add complexity or require constant outside support, they risk becoming another layer of dependency.\n\n\n\nHorizon1000 sits at that intersection. As aid budgets tighten and healthcare demands rise, the project offers a test of whether AI can play a useful, limited role in primary care without overstating its reach. The outcome will depend less on the technology itself than on how well it fits into the systems meant to use it.\n\n\n\nSee also: SAP and Fresenius to build sovereign AI backbone for healthcare\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "title": "FlashLabs Researchers Release Chroma 1.0: A 4B Real Time Speech Dialogue Model With Personalized Voice Cloning",
      "content": "Chroma 1.0 is a real time speech to speech dialogue model that takes audio as input and returns audio as output while preserving the speaker identity across multi turn conversations. It is presented as the first open source end to end spoken dialogue system that combines low latency interaction with high fidelity personalized voice cloning from only a few seconds of reference audio.\n\n\n\nThe model operates directly on discrete speech representations rather than on text transcripts. It targets the same use cases as commercial real time agents, but with a compact 4B parameter dialogue core and a design that treats speaker similarity as a primary objective, not as an auxiliary feature. Chroma achieves a reported 10.96% relative improvement in speaker similarity over a human baseline and reaches a Real Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43, so it can generate speech more than 2 times faster than playback.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141\n\n\nFrom cascaded ASR  LLM  TTS  end to end S2S\n\n\n\nMost production assistants still use a three stage pipeline, automatic speech recognition to convert audio to text, a large language model for reasoning, and text to speech synthesis. This structure is flexible but it introduces latency and loses paralinguistic information such as timbre, emotion, speaking rate and prosody once the system collapses audio to text. In real time dialogue this loss of acoustic detail directly hurts speaker fidelity and naturalness.\n\n\n\nChroma follows the newer class of speech to speech systems that map between sequences of codec tokens. A speech tokenizer and neural codec produce quantized acoustic codes. A language model then reasons and responds over a sequence that interleaves text tokens and audio codes, without an explicit intermediate transcript. This keeps the model conditioned on prosody and speaker identity during the whole processing chain.\n\n\n\nArchitecture, Reasoner + speech generation stack\n\n\n\nChroma 1.0 has two main subsystems. The Chroma Reasoner handles multimodal understanding and text generation. The speech stack, Chroma Backbone, Chroma Decoder and Chroma Codec Decoder, converts that semantic output into personalized response audio.\n\n\n\nThe Chroma Reasoner is built on the Thinker module from the Qwen-omni series and uses the Qwen2 Audio encoding pipeline. It processes text and audio inputs with shared front ends, fuses them with cross modal attention, and aligns them over time using Time aligned Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (TM-RoPE). The output is a sequence of hidden states that carry both linguistic content and acoustic cues, for example rhythm and emphasis.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141\n\n\nThe Chroma Backbone is a 1B parameter LLaMA style model based on Llama3. It is conditioned on the target voice using CSM-1B, which encodes a short reference audio clip and its transcript into embedding prompts that are prepended to the sequence. During inference, token embeddings and hidden states from the Reasoner are fed as unified context, so the Backbone always sees the semantic state of the dialogue while it generates acoustic codes.\n\n\n\nTo support streaming, the system uses a fixed 1 to 2 interleaving schedule. For every text token from the Reasoner, the Backbone produces 2 audio code tokens. This allows the model to start emitting speech as soon as text generation begins and avoids waiting for full sentences. This interleaving is the main mechanism behind the low Time to First Token.\n\n\n\nThe Chroma Decoder is a lightweight LLaMA variant with about 100M parameters. The Backbone predicts only the first Residual Vector Quantization codebook per frame, which is a coarse representation. The Decoder then takes the Backbone hidden state and the first code and autoregressively predicts the remaining RVQ levels inside the same frame. This factorization keeps long context temporal structure in the Backbone and restricts the Decoder to frame local refinement, which reduces compute and improves detailed prosody and articulation.\n\n\n\nThe Chroma Codec Decoder concatenates the coarse and refined codes and maps them to waveform samples. It follows the decoder design of the Mimi vocoder and uses a causal convolutional neural network so that each output sample depends only on past context, which is required for streaming. The system uses 8 codebooks, which cuts the number of autoregressive refinement steps for the Decoder while preserving enough detail for voice cloning.\n\n\n\nTraining setup and synthetic speech to speech (S2S) data\n\n\n\nHigh quality speech dialogue data with strong reasoning signals is scarce. Chroma therefore uses a synthetic speech to speech (S2S) pipeline. A Reasoner like LLM first produces textual answers for user questions. A Test to Speech (TTS) system then synthesizes target speech that matches the timbre of the reference audio for those answers. These synthetic pairs train the Backbone and Decoder to perform acoustic modeling and voice cloning. The Reasoner stays frozen and acts as a provider of text embeddings and multimodal hidden states.\n\n\n\nVoice cloning quality and comparison with existing systems\n\n\n\nObjective evaluation uses the SEED-TTS-EVAL protocol on English CommonVoice speakers. Chroma operates at 24 kHz sampling rate and achieves a Speaker Similarity score of 0.81. The human baseline is 0.73. CosyVoice-3 reaches 0.72 and most other TTS baselines lie below the human reference. The research team report this as a 10.96% relative improvement over the human baseline, which indicates that the model captures fine paralinguistic details more consistently than human recordings in this metric.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141\n\n\nSubjective evaluation compares Chroma with the ElevenLabs eleven_multilingual_v2 model. In naturalness CMOS, listeners prefer ElevenLabs 57.2% of the time versus 24.4% for Chroma, with 18.3% deuce. In speaker similarity CMOS, the scores are very close, 42.4% for ElevenLabs and 40.6% for Chroma, with 17.0% deuce. A follow up test asking which audio sounds more natural between ElevenLabs and the original recordings yields 92.0% preference for ElevenLabs versus 8.0% for ground truth, which shows that perceived naturalness and speaker fidelity are not aligned.\n\n\n\nLatency and real-time behavior\n\n\n\nLatency is measured with one concurrent stream. For a 38.80 second response, the total generation time is 16.58 seconds, which gives a Real Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43. The Reasoner contributes 119.12 ms TTFT, the Backbone 8.48 ms and the Decoder 19.27 ms per frame on average. The Codec Decoder works on groups of 4 frames so TTFT does not apply to that component. The overall Time to First Token is 146.87 ms, which is well under one second and suitable for interactive dialogue.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141\n\n\nSpoken dialogue and reasoning benchmarks\n\n\n\nChroma is evaluated on the basic track of URO Bench. It uses only 4B parameters yet achieves an overall task accomplishment score of 57.44%. GLM-4 Voice, a 9B parameter model, leads with 69.09%. Chroma ranks second overall and outperforms several 7B and 0.5B omni baselines on many dimensions. It reaches 71.14% on Storal, 51.69% on TruthfulQA and 22.74% on GSM8K. For oral conversation metrics it attains the highest scores on MLC at 60.26% and on CommonVoice at 62.07%.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141\n\n\nCritically, Chroma is the only model in this comparison that supports personalized voice cloning. All other systems focus on spoken dialogue and reasoning only. This means Chroma provides competitive cognitive capability while also performing high fidelity voice personalization in real time.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nEnd to end real time speech to speech: Chroma 1.0 is a 4B parameter spoken dialogue model that maps speech to speech directly using codec tokens, it avoids explicit ASR and TTS stages and preserves prosody and speaker identity through the whole pipeline.\n\n\n\nReasoner plus speech stack architecture: The system combines a Qwen-based Chroma Reasoner with a 1B LLaMA style Backbone, a 100M Chroma Decoder and a Mimi based Codec Decoder, it uses RVQ codebooks and an interleaved 1 to 2 text to audio token schedule to support streaming and low Time to First Token.\n\n\n\nStrong personalized voice cloning: On SEED-TTS-EVAL with CommonVoice speakers, Chroma reaches a Speaker Similarity score of 0.81 at 24 kHz, this is reported as a 10.96 percent relative improvement over the human baseline of 0.73 and outperforms CosyVoice 3 and other TTS baselines.\n\n\n\nSub second latency and faster than real time generation: Single stream inference on an H200 GPU yields an overall Time to First Token of about 147 ms, for a 38.80 second response the model generates audio in 16.58 seconds, resulting in a Real Time Factor of 0.43 which is more than 2 times faster than playback.\n\n\n\nCompetitive dialogue and reasoning with cloning as a unique feature: On URO Bench basic track, Chroma attains 57.44 percent overall task accomplishment and competitive scores on Storal, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, MLC and CommonVoice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Paper, Model Weights, Project and Playground. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content_html": "<p>Chroma 1.0 is a real time speech to speech dialogue model that takes audio as input and returns audio as output while preserving the speaker identity across multi turn conversations. It is presented as the first open source end to end spoken dialogue system that combines low latency interaction with high fidelity personalized voice cloning from only a few seconds of reference audio.</p>\n<p>The model operates directly on discrete speech representations rather than on text transcripts. It targets the same use cases as commercial real time agents, but with a compact 4B parameter dialogue core and a design that treats speaker similarity as a primary objective, not as an auxiliary feature. Chroma achieves a reported 10.96% relative improvement in speaker similarity over a human baseline and reaches a Real Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43, so it can generate speech more than 2 times faster than playback.</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141</p>\n<p>From cascaded ASR  LLM  TTS  end to end S2S</p>\n<p>Most production assistants still use a three stage pipeline, automatic speech recognition to convert audio to text, a large language model for reasoning, and text to speech synthesis. This structure is flexible but it introduces latency and loses paralinguistic information such as timbre, emotion, speaking rate and prosody once the system collapses audio to text. In real time dialogue this loss of acoustic detail directly hurts speaker fidelity and naturalness.</p>\n<p>Chroma follows the newer class of speech to speech systems that map between sequences of codec tokens. A speech tokenizer and neural codec produce quantized acoustic codes. A language model then reasons and responds over a sequence that interleaves text tokens and audio codes, without an explicit intermediate transcript. This keeps the model conditioned on prosody and speaker identity during the whole processing chain.</p>\n<p>Architecture, Reasoner + speech generation stack</p>\n<p>Chroma 1.0 has two main subsystems. The Chroma Reasoner handles multimodal understanding and text generation. The speech stack, Chroma Backbone, Chroma Decoder and Chroma Codec Decoder, converts that semantic output into personalized response audio.</p>\n<p>The Chroma Reasoner is built on the Thinker module from the Qwen-omni series and uses the Qwen2 Audio encoding pipeline. It processes text and audio inputs with shared front ends, fuses them with cross modal attention, and aligns them over time using Time aligned Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (TM-RoPE). The output is a sequence of hidden states that carry both linguistic content and acoustic cues, for example rhythm and emphasis.</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11141</p>\n<p>The Chroma Backbone is a 1B parameter LLaMA style model based on Llama3. It is conditioned on the target voice using CSM-1B, which encodes a short reference audio clip and its transcript into embedding prompts that are prepended to the sequence. During inference, token embeddings and hidden states from the Reasoner are fed as unified context, so the Backbone always sees the semantic state of the dialogue while it generates acoustic codes.</p>\n<p>To support streaming, the system uses a fixed 1 to 2 interleaving schedule. For every text token from the Reasoner, the Backbone produces 2 audio code tokens. This allows the model to start emitting speech as soon as text generation begins and avoids waiting for full sentences. This interleaving is the main mechanism behind the low Time to First Token.</p>\n<p>The Chroma Decoder is a lightweight LLaMA variant with about 100M parameters. The Backbone predicts only the first Residual Vector Quantization codebook per frame, which is a coarse representation. The Decoder then takes the Backbone hidden state and the first code and autoregressively predicts the remaining RVQ levels inside the same frame. This factorization keeps long context temporal structure in the Backbone and restricts the Decoder to frame local refinement, which reduces compute and improves detailed prosody and articulation.</p>\n<p>The Chroma Codec Decoder concatenates the coarse and refined codes and maps them to waveform samples. It follows the decoder design of the Mimi vocoder and uses a causal convolutional neural network so that each output sample depends only on past context, which is required for streaming. The system uses 8 codebooks, which cuts the number of autoregressive refinement steps for the Decoder while preserving enough detail for voice cloning.</p>\n<p>Training setup and synthetic speech to speech (S2S) data</p>\n<p>High quality speech dialogue data with strong reasoning signals is scarce.

      "content": "Eightfold AI, an AI recruitment platform based in the US and used by companies such as Microsoft and PayPal, as well as various Fortune 500 firms, is being sued in California for reportedly compiling applicant screening reports without their consent.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on January 20, marks the first case in the US to accuse an AI recruitment firm of breaching the Fair Credit Reporting Act, according to the legal firms that initiated the suit. It also highlights how consumer advocates are seeking to enforce existing laws on AI systems that can infer information about individuals through extensive data analysis.\n\n\n\n“In order to protect against the harms of such reports, the FCRA requires consumer reporting agencies like Eightfold to make certain disclosures, obtain certain certifications, and ensure that consumers (here, job applicants) have a mechanism to review and correct reports that are provided to prospective employers for purposes of determining eligibility for employment,” the suit said. \n\n\n\nThe startup offers tools to speed up hiring by assessing job applicants and predicting their fit for positions using data from online resumes and job listings.\n\n\n\n&#8220;There is no AI-exemption to these laws, which, for decades, have been an essential tool in protecting job applicants from abuses by third parties, like background check companies, that profit by collecting information about and evaluating job applicants,&#8221; they said in the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nHowever, individuals seeking employment at firms that use these technologies are not informed or given an opportunity to contest inaccuracies, as alleged by Erin Kistler and Sruti Bhaumik in their proposed class-action lawsuit.\n\n\n\nAs a result, they assert that Eightfold breached the FCRA and a California statute that grants consumers the right to access and dispute credit reports utilised in hiring and lending.\n\n\n\nAccording to Eightfold representative Kurt Foeller, the platform operates on data provided by candidates or clients, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\n\n&#8220;We do not scrape social media and the like. We are deeply committed to responsible AI, transparency, and compliance with applicable data protection and employment laws,&#8221; Foeller said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Eightfold generates consumer reports for potential employers using its Evaluation Tools. They evaluate job candidates not just as individuals by claiming to pinpoint their likely skills, experiences, and traits, but also in relation to each other, ranking applicants on a scale from 0 to 5 based on the findings, conclusions, and assumptions derived from Eightfold’s proprietary AI regarding their “likelihood of success.”\n\n\n\nEightfold creates talent profiles of job seekers that include personality descriptions such as ‘team player’ and ‘introvert’, ranks their ‘quality of education’, and predicts their future titles and companies, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n“Employers use these reports to sift through applications, typically only reviewing highly ranked candidates. Lower-ranked candidates are often discarded before a human being ever looks at their application,” the lawsuit said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKistler and Bhaumik filed a lawsuit in California state court on behalf of all job applicants in the US who were assessed using the company’s tools. The proposed class is represented by the labour law firm Outten &amp; Golden and the nonprofit advocacy organisation Towards Justice.\n\n\n\nKistler sought positions at various companies that use Eightfold, including PayPal, while Bhaumik pursued opportunities at firms like Microsoft, as stated in the complaint. Both individuals have degrees in science or technology and over a decade of experience. They were not selected for employment, and each believes that Eightfold&#8217;s tools contributed to this outcome.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMicrosoft and PayPal are not named as defendants in the lawsuit.\nThe post AI Recruitment Platform Eightfold Sued for Screening Job Applicants Without Consent appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

These tools continuously patrol major ecosystems – including Salesforce Agentforce, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI – to identify running agents.

Consider a CISO in the banking sector. Under standard operations, verifying a new loan-processing agent involves manually chasing documentation from development teams.

This capability ensures security teams view real-time data rather than outdated snapshots.\n\n\n\nFrom a financial perspective, visibility drives consolidation.

This is particularly relevant for sectors like logistics, where teams may build internal tools for proprietary database optimisation. Instead of remaining hidden, these assets can be registered and made discoverable for reuse across the company.\n\n\n\nJonathan Harvey, Head of AI Operations at Capita, said: &#8220;Agent Scanners will let us focus on innovation instead of inventory management.

It brings together and helps us orchestrate all of the agents and MCP servers we&#8217;re building in customer support, chat, and voice interactions. It isn&#8217;t just a tool; it&#8217;s a huge enabler for everything we&#8217;re doing next.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe transition to an &#8220;Agentic Enterprise&#8221; requires a change in governance around how IT assets are tracked, rendering the days of managing integrations via stale spreadsheets incompatible with the speed of AI agent deployment. \n\n\n\nLeaders must assume their inventory of AI agents is incomplete and deploy automated scanning tools to establish a baseline of truth. Once this baseline is established, governance policies should mandate that all agents – whether bought or built – expose their capabilities and data access privileges in a standardised format like A2A to facilitate monitoring.\n\n\n\nFinally, executives can use the visibility provided by these tools to audit spend, identifying duplicate functionalities across cloud environments and merging them to control the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs organisations move from pilot programmes to mass deployment, the differentiator will not be the intelligence of individual agents, but the coherence of the network that connects them.\n\n\n\nSee also: Balancing AI cost efficiency with data sovereignty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

We need to make moves to ensure our survival and intact mental health.”</p>\n<p>Manufacturing bogus bugs</p>\n<p>His comments came as cURL users complained that the move was treating the symptoms caused by AI slop without addressing the cause. The users said they were concerned the move would eliminate a key means for ensuring and maintaining the security of the tool. Stenberg largely agreed, but indicated his team had little choice.Read full article</p>\n<p>Comments</p>"

      "content": "Nearly 60% of Indian businesses confident about scaling artificial intelligence responsibly already have mature Responsible AI (RAI) frameworks, but persistent gaps around high-quality data, regulatory clarity and emerging AI risks threaten to slow safe adoption, according to a Nasscom report released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nRAI frameworks guide the ethical, safe and accountable design, development and deployment of AI systems.\n\n\n\nThe State of Responsible AI in India 2025 survey flagged hallucinations as the most frequently experienced risk, cited by 56% of respondents, followed by privacy violations (36%), lack of explainability (35%), and unintended bias or discrimination (29%).On implementation barriers, lack of high-quality data tops the list at 43%, while regulatory uncertainty (20%) and shortage of skilled personnel (15%) continue to weigh on organisations.Regulatory ambiguity is a key concern for large enterprises and startups, whereas small and medium enterprises (SMEs) cite high implementation costs as their second-biggest challenge.\n\n\n\nThe report was released at Nasscom’s Responsible Intelligence Confluence in New Delhi. It is based on a survey conducted between October and November 2025 of 574 senior executives from large enterprises, SMEs, and startups involved in the commercial development and use of AI in India.\n\n\n\nDespite these risks, the survey shows steady progress since 2023. About 30% of Indian businesses have established mature RAI practices, while 45% are actively implementing formal frameworks, indicating a shift from basic awareness to structured strategies and policies.Nasscom noted a direct correlation between AI maturity and responsible practices, with stronger AI capabilities translating into more robust RAI frameworks.\n\n\n\n“Nearly 60% of businesses confident in scaling AI responsibly have mature practices in place,” the report said.\n\n\n\nLarge enterprises lead RAI maturity at 46%, while SMEs and startups stand at 20% and 16%, respectively. Sector-wise, BFSI is the most mature at 35%, followed by technology, media and telecom at 31%, and healthcare at 18%, with nearly half of firms in these sectors actively strengthening their frameworks.\n\n\n\nWorkforce readiness is emerging as a priority, with nearly nine in 10 organisations investing in sensitisation and training.Business leaders expressed the highest confidence in meeting data protection obligations, reflecting relatively mature privacy frameworks, although monitoring-related compliances remain a concern.\n\n\n\nAccountability for Responsible AI remains largely top-down, with 48% of organisations placing responsibility with the C-suite or board.However, 26% now assign it to departmental heads, and AI ethics boards are gaining traction. Among mature organisations, 65% have constituted AI ethics boards or committees, though some companies remain cautious about their effectiveness.\n\n\n\nSangeeta Gupta, senior VP and chief strategy officer at Nasscom, said in a statement that responsible AI has become foundational as AI gets embedded into critical decisions.\n\n\n\n“The real measure of India&#8217;s AI leadership will not just be in the scale of adoption, but in how responsibly and inclusively these systems are designed and deployed,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe added that businesses must move beyond compliance-led approaches. “With the right investments in governance, talent, and transparent frameworks, India has the opportunity to set global benchmarks for trustworthy AI that serves society at large.”\n\n\n\n\nThe post 60% AI-ready Firms Mature on Responsible AI, Gaps Persist: Nasscom Report appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",
