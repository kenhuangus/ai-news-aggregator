Huge thanks to everyone who contributed to the previous guides: u/BlueVajra, u/stratofax, u/antoniocs, u/GeckoLogic, u/headset38, u/tulensrma, u/jcheroske, and the rest of the community. Your feedback made each version better.\n\nClaude Code 2.1.x shipped 1,096+ commits in January alone. This isn't an incremental update - it's a fundamental shift in how Claude Code manages context, delegates work, and scales.\n\n**What's new in V4:**\n\n* **Part 9: MCP Tool Search** \\- 85% context reduction with lazy loading\n* **Part 10: Custom Agents** \\- Automatic delegation to specialists\n* **Part 11: Session Teleportation** \\- Move sessions between devices\n* **Part 12: Background Tasks** \\- Parallel agent execution\n* **Part 13: New Commands &amp; Shortcuts** \\- `/config` search, `/stats` filtering, custom keybindings\n* Updated GitHub repo with V4 templates coming soon\n\n**TL;DR:** MCP Tool Search reduces context overhead by 85% (77K -&gt; 8.7K tokens) by lazy-loading tools on-demand. Custom Agents let you create specialists that Claude invokes automatically - each with isolated context windows. Session Teleportation lets you move work between terminal and claude.ai/code seamlessly. Background Tasks enable parallel agent execution with Ctrl+B. And the new Setup hook automates repository initialization.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Foundation (From V1-V3)\n\n* [Part 1: The Global CLAUDE.md as Security Gatekeeper](#part-1-the-global-claudemd-as-security-gatekeeper)\n* [Part 2: Global Rules for New Project Scaffolding](#part-2-global-rules-for-new-project-scaffolding)\n* [Part 3: MCP Servers - Claude's Integrations](#part-3-mcp-servers--claudes-integrations)\n* [Part 4: Commands - Personal Shortcuts](#part-4-commands--personal-shortcuts)\n* [Part 5: Skills - Reusable Expertise](#part-5-skills--reusable-expertise)\n* [Part 6: Why Single-Purpose Chats Are Critical](#part-6-why-single-purpose-chats-are-critical)\n* [Part 7: Hooks - Deterministic Enforcement](#part-7-hooks--deterministic-enforcement)\n* [Part 8: LSP - IDE-Level Code Intelligence](#part-8-lsp--ide-level-code-intelligence)\n\n# New in V4\n\n* [Part 9: MCP Tool Search - The 85% Context Revolution](#part-9-mcp-tool-search--the-85-context-revolution)\n* [Part 10: Custom Agents - Automatic Delegation](#part-10-custom-agents--automatic-delegation)\n* [Part 11: Session Teleportation](#part-11-session-teleportation)\n* [Part 12: Background Tasks &amp; Parallel Execution](#part-12-background-tasks--parallel-execution)\n* [Part 13: New Commands, Shortcuts &amp; Quality of Life](#part-13-new-commands-shortcuts--quality-of-life)\n\n# Reference\n\n* [Quick Reference](#quick-reference)\n* [GitHub Repo](#github-repo)\n* [Sources](#sources)\n\n# Part 1: The Global [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) as Security Gatekeeper\n\n# The Memory Hierarchy\n\nClaude Code loads CLAUDE.md files in a specific order:\n\n|Level|Location|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Enterprise**|`/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`|Org-wide policies|\n|**Global User**|`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`|Your standards for ALL projects|\n|**Project**|`./CLAUDE.md`|Team-shared project instructions|\n|**Project Local**|`./CLAUDE.local.md`|Personal project overrides|\n\nYour global file applies to **every single project** you work on.\n\n# What Belongs in Global\n\n**1. Identity &amp; Authentication**\n\n    ## GitHub Account\n    **ALWAYS** use **YourUsername** for all projects:\n    - SSH: `git@github.com:YourUsername/&lt;repo&gt;.git`\n    \n    ## Docker Hub\n    Already authenticated. Username in `~/.env` as `DOCKER_HUB_USER`\n\n**Why global?** You use the same accounts everywhere. Define once, inherit everywhere.\n\n**2. The Gatekeeper Rules**\n\n    ## NEVER EVER DO\n    \n    These rules are ABSOLUTE:\n    \n    ### NEVER Publish Sensitive Data\n    - NEVER publish passwords, API keys, tokens to git/npm/docker\n    - Before ANY commit: verify no secrets included\n    \n    ### NEVER Commit .env Files\n    - NEVER commit `.env` to git\n    - ALWAYS verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`\n\n# Why This Matters: Claude Reads Your .env\n\n[Security researchers discovered](https://www.knostic.ai/blog/claude-loads-secrets-without-permission) that Claude Code **automatically reads** `.env` **files** without explicit permission. [Backslash Security warns](https://www.backslash.security/blog/claude-code-security-best-practices):\n\n&gt;\"If not restricted, Claude can read `.env`, AWS credentials, or `secrets.json` and leak them through 'helpful suggestions.'\"\n\nYour global CLAUDE.md creates a **behavioral gatekeeper** \\- even if Claude has access, it won't output secrets.\n\n# Syncing Global [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) Across Machines\n\nIf you work on multiple computers, sync your `~/.claude/` directory using a dotfiles manager:\n\n    # Using GNU Stow\n    cd ~/dotfiles\n    stow claude  # Symlinks ~/.claude to dotfiles/claude/.claude\n\nThis gives you:\n\n* Version control on your settings\n* Consistent configuration everywhere\n* Easy recovery if something breaks\n\n# Defense in Depth\n\n|Layer|What|How|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Behavioral rules|Global CLAUDE.md \"NEVER\" rules|\n|2|Access control|Deny list in settings.json|\n|3|Git safety|.gitignore|\n\n# Team Workflows: Evolving [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)\n\n[Boris Cherny shares how Anthropic's Claude Code team does it](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177):\n\n&gt;\"Our team shares a single CLAUDE.md for the Claude Code repo. We check it into git, and the whole team contributes multiple times a week.\"\n\n**The pattern:** Mistakes become documentation.\n\n    Claude makes mistake -&gt; You fix it -&gt; You add rule to CLAUDE.md -&gt; Never happens again\n\n# Part 2: Global Rules for New Project Scaffolding\n\nYour global CLAUDE.md becomes a **project factory**. Every new project automatically inherits your standards.\n\n# The Problem Without Scaffolding Rules\n\n[Research from project scaffolding experts](https://github.com/madison-hutson/claude-project-scaffolding):\n\n&gt;\"LLM-assisted development fails by silently expanding scope, degrading quality, and losing architectural intent.\"\n\n# The Solution\n\n    ## New Project Setup\n    \n    When creating ANY new project:\n    \n    ### Required Files\n    - `.env` - Environment variables (NEVER commit)\n    - `.env.example` - Template with placeholders\n    - `.gitignore` - Must include: .env, node_modules/, dist/\n    - `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview\n    \n    ### Required Structure\n    project/\n    ├── src/\n    ├── tests/\n    ├── docs/\n    ├── .claude/\n    │   ├── skills/\n    │   ├── agents/\n    │   └── commands/\n    └── scripts/\n    \n    ### Node.js Requirements\n    Add to entry point:\n    process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) =&gt; {\n      console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason);\n      process.exit(1);\n    });\n\nWhen you say \"create a new Node.js project,\" Claude reads this and **automatically** creates the correct structure.\n\n# Part 3: MCP Servers - Claude's Integrations\n\n[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) lets Claude interact with external tools.\n\n# Adding MCP Servers\n\n    claude mcp add &lt;server-name&gt; -- &lt;command&gt;\n    claude mcp list\n    claude mcp remove &lt;server-name&gt;\n\n# When NOT to Use MCP\n\nMCP servers consume tokens and context. For simple integrations, consider alternatives:\n\n|Use Case|MCP Overhead|Alternative|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Trello tasks|High|CLI tool (`trello-cli`)|\n|Simple HTTP calls|Overkill|`curl` via Bash|\n|One-off queries|Wasteful|Direct command|\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If you're calling an MCP tool once per session, a CLI is more efficient. MCP shines for *repeated* tool use within conversations.\n\n**UPDATE V4:** With MCP Tool Search (Part 9), this tradeoff changes significantly. You can now have many more MCP servers without paying the upfront context cost.\n\n# Recommended MCP Servers for Developers\n\n# Core Development\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Context7**|Live docs for any library|`claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`|\n|**GitHub**|PRs, issues, CI/CD|`claude mcp add github -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`|\n|**Filesystem**|Advanced file operations|`claude mcp add filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`|\n|**Sequential Thinking**|Structured problem-solving|`claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking`|\n\n# Databases\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MongoDB**|Atlas/Community, Performance Advisor|`claude mcp add mongodb -- npx -y mongodb-mcp-server`|\n|**PostgreSQL**|Query Postgres naturally|`claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`|\n|**DBHub**|Universal (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)|`claude mcp add db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub`|\n\n# Documents &amp; RAG\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Docling**|PDF/DOCX parsing, 97.9% table accuracy|`claude mcp add docling -- uvx docling-mcp-server`|\n|**Qdrant**|Vector search, semantic memory|`claude mcp add qdrant -- npx -y @qdrant/mcp-server`|\n|**Chroma**|Embeddings, vector DB|`claude mcp add chroma -- npx -y @chroma/mcp-server`|\n\n# Browser &amp; Testing\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Playwright**|E2E testing, scraping|`claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/playwright-mcp`|\n|**Browser MCP**|Use your logged-in Chrome|[browsermcp.io](https://browsermcp.io)|\n\n# Cloud &amp; DevOps\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**AWS**|S3, Lambda, CloudWatch|`claude mcp add aws -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/aws-mcp`|\n|**Docker**|Container management|`claude mcp add docker -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/docker-mcp`|\n|**Kubernetes**|Cluster operations|`claude mcp add k8s -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/kubernetes-mcp`|\n\n# Part 4: Commands - Personal Shortcuts\n\nCommands are personal macros that expand into prompts. Store them in:\n\n* `~/.claude/commands/` \\- Available everywhere\n* `.claude/commands/` \\- Project-specific\n\n# Basic Command\n\nCreate `~/.claude/commands/review.md`:\n\n    ---\n    description: Review code for issues\n    ---\n    \n    Review this code for:\n    1. Security vulnerabilities\n    2. Performance issues\n    3. Error handling gaps\n    4. Code style violations\n\n**Usage:** Type `/review` in any session.\n\n# Command with Arguments\n\nCreate `~/.claude/commands/ticket.md`:\n\n    ---\n    description: Create a ticket from description\n    argument-hint: &lt;ticket-description&gt;\n    ---\n    \n    Create a detailed ticket for: $ARGUMENTS\n    \n    Include:\n    - User story\n    - Acceptance criteria\n    - Technical notes\n\n**Usage:** `/ticket Add dark mode support`\n\n# Advanced: Commands with Bash Execution\n\n    ---\n    description: Smart commit with context\n    allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)\n    argument-hint: [message]\n    ---\n    \n    ## Context\n    - Current git status: !`git status`\n    - Current git diff: !`git diff HEAD`\n    - Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`\n    - Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`\n    \n    ## Task\n    Create a commit with message: $ARGUMENTS\n\nThe `!` backtick syntax runs bash commands before the prompt is processed.\n\n# Part 5: Skills - Reusable Expertise\n\nSkills are **triggered expertise** that load only when needed. Unlike CLAUDE.md (always loaded), skills use progressive disclosure to save context.\n\n# Creating a Skill\n\nCreate `.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ---\n    name: Code Review\n    description: Comprehensive code review with security focus\n    triggers:\n      - review\n      - audit\n      - check code\n    ---\n    \n    # Code Review Skill\n    \n    When reviewing code:\n    1. Check for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)\n    2. Look for performance issues (N+1 queries, memory leaks)\n    3. Verify error handling (edge cases, null checks)\n    4. Assess test coverage\n    5. Review naming and documentation\n\n# Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use **progressive disclosure** for token efficiency:\n\n1. **Startup**: Only name/description loaded (\\~50 tokens)\n2. **Triggered**: Full SKILL.md content loaded\n3. **As needed**: Additional resources loaded\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If instructions apply to &lt;20% of conversations, make it a skill instead of putting it in CLAUDE.md.\n\n# V4 Update: Automatic Skill Discovery\n\nClaude Code now automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills` directories when working with files in subdirectories. No need to reference the root - skills are found recursively.\n\n# Part 6: Why Single-Purpose Chats Are Critical\n\n**Research consistently shows mixing topics destroys accuracy.**\n\n[Studies on multi-turn conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06120):\n\n&gt;\"An average **39% performance drop** when instructions are delivered across multiple turns.\"\n\n[Chroma Research on context rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot):\n\n&gt;\"As tokens in the context window increase, the model's ability to accurately recall information decreases.\"\n\n# The Golden Rule\n\n&gt;**\"One Task, One Chat\"**\n\n|Scenario|Action|\n|:-|:-|\n|New feature|New chat|\n|Bug fix (unrelated)|`/clear` then new task|\n|Research vs implementation|Separate chats|\n|20+ turns elapsed|Start fresh|\n\n# Use /clear Liberally\n\n    /clear\n\n[Anthropic recommends](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\n\n&gt;\"Use `/clear` frequently between tasks to reset the context window.\"\n\n# V4 Update: Context Window Visibility\n\nYou can now see exactly where your context is going:\n\n    /context\n\nNew status line fields:\n\n* `context_window.used_percentage`\n* `context_window.remaining_percentage`\n\n# Part 7: Hooks - Deterministic Enforcement\n\nCLAUDE.md rules are **suggestions** Claude can ignore under context pressure.

Slow and imprecise.\n\nWith LSP, Claude has **semantic understanding** \\- it knows that `getUserById` in file A calls the function defined in file B, not just that the text matches.\n\n**Performance:** 900x faster (50ms vs 45 seconds for cross-codebase navigation)\n\n# Supported Languages\n\nPython, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, PHP, Kotlin, Ruby, HTML/CSS\n\n# Setup\n\nLSP is built-in as of v2.0.74. For older versions:\n\n    export ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1\n\n# Part 9: MCP Tool Search - The 85% Context Revolution\n\n**This is the biggest change in V4.**\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvery MCP server you connect brings tool definitions - descriptions, parameters, schemas. Before Tool Search, Claude loaded **all of them** at startup:\n\n    Before:\n    Loading 73 MCP tools... [39.8k tokens]\n    Loading 56 agents... [9.7k tokens]\n    Loading system tools... [22.6k tokens]\n    Ready with 92k tokens remaining.  ← 54% context GONE before you type anything\n\nUsers reported 50-70% of their 200K context consumed before writing a single prompt.\n\n# The Solution: Lazy Loading\n\n[Claude Code 2.1.7](https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/claude-code-just-got-updated-with-one-of-the-most-requested-user-features) introduced MCP Tool Search:\n\n    After:\n    Loading tool registry... [5k tokens]\n    Ready with 195k tokens available.  ← 95% context preserved\n    \n    User: \"I need to query the database\"\n    &gt; Auto-loading: postgres-mcp [+1.2k tokens]\n    &gt; 193.8k tokens remaining\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Detection**: Claude Code checks if MCP tool descriptions would use &gt;10% of context\n2. **Registry Creation**: Builds lightweight index of tool names and descriptions\n3. **On-Demand Loading**: Tools load only when Claude determines they're needed\n4. **Intelligent Caching**: Loaded tools stay available for session duration\n\n# The Numbers\n\n|Metric|Before|After|Improvement|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Initial context usage|\\~77K tokens|\\~8.7K tokens|**85% reduction**|\n|Opus 4 accuracy|49%|74%|\\+25 percentage points|\n|Opus 4.5 accuracy|79.5%|88.1%|\\+8.6 percentage points|\n\n# Configuration\n\nMCP Tool Search is **enabled by default** when tools would consume &gt;10% of context.\n\nTo check your context usage:\n\n    /context\n\nTo disable for specific servers (if you always need certain tools immediately):\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"always-needed\": {\n          \"command\": \"...\",\n          \"enable_tool_search\": false\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nTo configure the auto-enable threshold:\n\n    {\n      \"mcp\": {\n        \"tool_search\": \"auto:15\"  // Enable at 15% context usage\n      }\n    }\n\n# What This Means for You\n\n* **More MCP servers**: Connect dozens without penalty\n* **Better accuracy**: Less noise = better tool selection\n* **Larger tasks**: More context for actual work\n* **No workflow changes**: Tools work exactly as before\n\nSimon Willison [commented](https://x.com/simonw/status/1879234567890123456):\n\n&gt;\"This fixes one of the most painful scaling issues with MCP setups. Was running 5 servers and watching context evaporate before any actual work began.\"\n\n# Part 10: Custom Agents - Automatic Delegation\n\nCustom Agents are specialized assistants that Claude invokes **automatically** \\- like how it automatically selects tools.\n\n# Why Custom Agents?\n\n|Problem|Solution|\n|:-|:-|\n|Context pollution from diverse tasks|Each agent has isolated context window|\n|Generic advice for specialized work|Agents have focused system prompts|\n|Manual orchestration overhead|Automatic delegation based on task|\n\n# Creating a Custom Agent\n\n**Method 1: Interactive (Recommended)**\n\n    /agents\n\nSelect \"Create new agent\" -&gt; Choose location (User or Project) -&gt; Generate with Claude or Manual.\n\n**Method 2: Manual**\n\nCreate `~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`:\n\n    ---\n    name: code-reviewer\n    description: Reviews code for security, performance, and best practices\n    tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n    model: sonnet\n    ---\n    \n    You are a senior code reviewer specializing in:\n    - Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)\n    - Performance antipatterns\n    - Error handling gaps\n    - Code maintainability\n    \n    When reviewing:\n    1. Start with security concerns\n    2. Then performance issues\n    3. Then style/maintainability\n    4. Provide specific line references\n    5. Suggest concrete fixes\n    \n    Be critical but constructive. Explain WHY something is a problem.\n\n# Agent Configuration Options\n\n    ---\n    name: agent-name              # Required\n    description: When to use      # Required - Claude uses this to decide delegation\n    tools: Read, Write, Bash      # Optional - inherits all if omitted\n    model: sonnet                 # Optional - sonnet, opus, or haiku\n    ---\n\n# How Automatic Delegation Works\n\nClaude delegates based on:\n\n1. Task description in your request\n2. `description` field in agent configurations\n3. Current context\n4. Available tools\n\n**Example:**\n\n    You: \"Review the authentication module for security issues\"\n    \n    Claude thinks: \"This is a code review task focusing on security\"\n    -&gt; Delegates to code-reviewer agent\n    -&gt; Agent runs with isolated context\n    -&gt; Returns findings to main conversation\n\n# Built-in Agents\n\nClaude Code includes these by default:\n\n|Agent|Purpose|When Used|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Explore**|Read-only codebase analysis|Searching, understanding code|\n|**Plan**|Research for planning|Plan mode context gathering|\n|**General-purpose**|Complex multi-step tasks|Exploration + modification needed|\n\n# Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep agents focused**: One specialty per agent\n2. **Write clear descriptions**: Claude uses these to decide delegation\n3. **Limit tools**: Read-only agents shouldn't have Write access\n4. **Test delegation**: Verify Claude routes tasks correctly\n5. **Start with 3-4 agents max**: Too many options can confuse routing\n\n# Hot Reload\n\nNew or updated agents in `~/.claude/agents/` or `.claude/agents/` are available **immediately** \\- no restart needed.\n\n# Part 11: Session Teleportation\n\nMove your work between terminal and claude.ai/code seamlessly.\n\n# Teleport to Web\n\n    /teleport\n\nOpens your current session at `claude.ai/code`.

Huge thanks to everyone who contributed to the previous guides: u/BlueVajra, u/stratofax, u/antoniocs, u/GeckoLogic, u/headset38, u/tulensrma, u/jcheroske, and the rest of the community. Your feedback made each version better.</p>\n<p>Claude Code 2.1.x shipped 1,096+ commits in January alone. This isn't an incremental update - it's a fundamental shift in how Claude Code manages context, delegates work, and scales.</p>\n<p><strong>What's new in V4:</strong></p>\n<p>* <strong>Part 9: MCP Tool Search</strong> \\- 85% context reduction with lazy loading</p>\n<p>* <strong>Part 10: Custom Agents</strong> \\- Automatic delegation to specialists</p>\n<p>* <strong>Part 11: Session Teleportation</strong> \\- Move sessions between devices</p>\n<p>* <strong>Part 12: Background Tasks</strong> \\- Parallel agent execution</p>\n<p>* <strong>Part 13: New Commands &amp; Shortcuts</strong> \\- `/config` search, `/stats` filtering, custom keybindings</p>\n<p>* Updated GitHub repo with V4 templates coming soon</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> MCP Tool Search reduces context overhead by 85% (77K -&gt; 8.7K tokens) by lazy-loading tools on-demand. Custom Agents let you create specialists that Claude invokes automatically - each with isolated context windows. Session Teleportation lets you move work between terminal and claude.ai/code seamlessly. Background Tasks enable parallel agent execution with Ctrl+B. And the new Setup hook automates repository initialization.</p>\n<p># Table of Contents</p>\n<p># Foundation (From V1-V3)</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-1-the-global-claudemd-as-security-gatekeeper\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 1: The Global CLAUDE.md as Security Gatekeeper</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-2-global-rules-for-new-project-scaffolding\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 2: Global Rules for New Project Scaffolding</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-3-mcp-servers--claudes-integrations\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 3: MCP Servers - Claude's Integrations</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-4-commands--personal-shortcuts\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 4: Commands - Personal Shortcuts</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-5-skills--reusable-expertise\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 5: Skills - Reusable Expertise</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-6-why-single-purpose-chats-are-critical\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 6: Why Single-Purpose Chats Are Critical</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-7-hooks--deterministic-enforcement\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 7: Hooks - Deterministic Enforcement</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-8-lsp--ide-level-code-intelligence\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 8: LSP - IDE-Level Code Intelligence</a></p>\n<p># New in V4</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-9-mcp-tool-search--the-85-context-revolution\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 9: MCP Tool Search - The 85% Context Revolution</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-10-custom-agents--automatic-delegation\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 10: Custom Agents - Automatic Delegation</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-11-session-teleportation\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 11: Session Teleportation</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-12-background-tasks--parallel-execution\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 12: Background Tasks &amp; Parallel Execution</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#part-13-new-commands-shortcuts--quality-of-life\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 13: New Commands, Shortcuts &amp; Quality of Life</a></p>\n<p># Reference</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#quick-reference\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quick Reference</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#github-repo\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Repo</a></p>\n<p>* <a href=\"#sources\" class=\"internal-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sources</a></p>\n<p># Part 1: The Global <a href=\"http://CLAUDE.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CLAUDE.md</a> as Security Gatekeeper</p>\n<p># The Memory Hierarchy</p>\n<p>Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md files in a specific order:</p>\n<p>|Level|Location|Purpose|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Enterprise</strong>|`/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`|Org-wide policies|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Global User</strong>|`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`|Your standards for ALL projects|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Project</strong>|`./CLAUDE.md`|Team-shared project instructions|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Project Local</strong>|`./CLAUDE.local.md`|Personal project overrides|</p>\n<p>Your global file applies to <strong>every single project</strong> you work on.</p>\n<p># What Belongs in Global</p>\n<p><strong>1.

For simple integrations, consider alternatives:</p>\n<p>|Use Case|MCP Overhead|Alternative|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|Trello tasks|High|CLI tool (`trello-cli`)|</p>\n<p>|Simple HTTP calls|Overkill|`curl` via Bash|</p>\n<p>|One-off queries|Wasteful|Direct command|</p>\n<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If you're calling an MCP tool once per session, a CLI is more efficient. MCP shines for *repeated* tool use within conversations.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE V4:</strong> With MCP Tool Search (Part 9), this tradeoff changes significantly. You can now have many more MCP servers without paying the upfront context cost.</p>\n<p># Recommended MCP Servers for Developers</p>\n<p># Core Development</p>\n<p>|Server|Purpose|Install|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Context7</strong>|Live docs for any library|`claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>GitHub</strong>|PRs, issues, CI/CD|`claude mcp add github -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Filesystem</strong>|Advanced file operations|`claude mcp add filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Sequential Thinking</strong>|Structured problem-solving|`claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking`|</p>\n<p># Databases</p>\n<p>|Server|Purpose|Install|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>MongoDB</strong>|Atlas/Community, Performance Advisor|`claude mcp add mongodb -- npx -y mongodb-mcp-server`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>PostgreSQL</strong>|Query Postgres naturally|`claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>DBHub</strong>|Universal (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)|`claude mcp add db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub`|</p>\n<p># Documents &amp; RAG</p>\n<p>|Server|Purpose|Install|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Docling</strong>|PDF/DOCX parsing, 97.9% table accuracy|`claude mcp add docling -- uvx docling-mcp-server`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Qdrant</strong>|Vector search, semantic memory|`claude mcp add qdrant -- npx -y @qdrant/mcp-server`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Chroma</strong>|Embeddings, vector DB|`claude mcp add chroma -- npx -y @chroma/mcp-server`|</p>\n<p># Browser &amp; Testing</p>\n<p>|Server|Purpose|Install|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Playwright</strong>|E2E testing, scraping|`claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/playwright-mcp`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Browser MCP</strong>|Use your logged-in Chrome|<a href=\"https://browsermcp.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">browsermcp.io</a>|</p>\n<p># Cloud &amp; DevOps</p>\n<p>|Server|Purpose|Install|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>AWS</strong>|S3, Lambda, CloudWatch|`claude mcp add aws -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/aws-mcp`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Docker</strong>|Container management|`claude mcp add docker -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/docker-mcp`|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Kubernetes</strong>|Cluster operations|`claude mcp add k8s -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/kubernetes-mcp`|</p>\n<p># Part 4: Commands - Personal Shortcuts</p>\n<p>Commands are personal macros that expand into prompts.

Check for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)</p>\n<p>2. Look for performance issues (N+1 queries, memory leaks)</p>\n<p>3. Verify error handling (edge cases, null checks)</p>\n<p>4. Assess test coverage</p>\n<p>5. Review naming and documentation</p>\n<p># Progressive Disclosure</p>\n<p>Skills use <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> for token efficiency:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Startup</strong>: Only name/description loaded (\\~50 tokens)</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Triggered</strong>: Full SKILL.md content loaded</p>\n<p>3. <strong>As needed</strong>: Additional resources loaded</p>\n<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If instructions apply to &lt;20% of conversations, make it a skill instead of putting it in CLAUDE.md.</p>\n<p># V4 Update: Automatic Skill Discovery</p>\n<p>Claude Code now automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills` directories when working with files in subdirectories.

Task description in your request</p>\n<p>2. `description` field in agent configurations</p>\n<p>3. Current context</p>\n<p>4. Available tools</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<p>You: \"Review the authentication module for security issues\"</p>\n<p>Claude thinks: \"This is a code review task focusing on security\"</p>\n<p>-&gt; Delegates to code-reviewer agent</p>\n<p>-&gt; Agent runs with isolated context</p>\n<p>-&gt; Returns findings to main conversation</p>\n<p># Built-in Agents</p>\n<p>Claude Code includes these by default:</p>\n<p>|Agent|Purpose|When Used|</p>\n<p>|:-|:-|:-|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Explore</strong>|Read-only codebase analysis|Searching, understanding code|</p>\n<p>|<strong>Plan</strong>|Research for planning|Plan mode context gathering|</p>\n<p>|<strong>General-purpose</strong>|Complex multi-step tasks|Exploration + modification needed|</p>\n<p># Best Practices</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Keep agents focused</strong>: One specialty per agent</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Write clear descriptions</strong>: Claude uses these to decide delegation</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Limit tools</strong>: Read-only agents shouldn't have Write access</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Test delegation</strong>: Verify Claude routes tasks correctly</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Start with 3-4 agents max</strong>: Too many options can confuse routing</p>\n<p># Hot Reload</p>\n<p>New or updated agents in `~/.claude/agents/` or `.claude/agents/` are available <strong>immediately</strong> \\- no restart needed.</p>\n<p># Part 11: Session Teleportation</p>\n<p>Move your work between terminal and claude.ai/code seamlessly.</p>\n<p># Teleport to Web</p>\n<p>/teleport</p>\n<p>Opens your current session at `claude.ai/code`.

      "content": "I specifically chose SD 1.5 for comparison because it is generally looked down upon and considered completely obsolete. However, thanks to the absence of RL (Reinforcement Learning) and distillation, it had several undeniable advantages:\n\n1. Diversity\n\nIt gave unpredictable and diversified results with every new seed. In models that came after it, you have to rewrite the prompt to get a new variant.\n\n\n\n2. Prompt Adherence\n\nSD 1.5 followed almost every word in the prompt. Zoom, camera angle, blur, prompts like \"jpeg\" or conversely \"masterpiece\" — isn't this a true prompt adherence? it allowed for very precise control over the final image.\n\n\n\n\"impossible perspective\" is a good example of what happened to newer models: due to RL aimed at \"beauty\" and benchmarking, new models simply do not understand unusual prompts like this. This is the reason why words like \"blur\" require separate anti-blur LoRAs to remove the blur from images. Photos with blur are simply \"preferable\" at the RL stage\n\n\n\n3. Style Mixing\n\nSD 1.5 had incredible diversity in understanding different styles. With SD 1.5, you could mix different styles using just a prompt and create new styles that couldn't be obtained any other way. (Newer models don't have this due to most artists being cut from datasets, but RL with distillation also bring a big effect here, as you can see in the examples).\n\n\n\nThis made SD 1.5 interesting to just \"explore\". It felt like you were traveling through latent space, discovering oddities and unusual things there. In models after SDXL, this effect disappeared; models became vending machines for outputting the same \"polished\" image.\n\n\n\nThe new z-image release is what a real model without RL and distillation looks like. I think it's a breath of fresh air and hopefully a way to go forward.\n\n\n\nWhen SD 1.5 came out, Midjourney appeared right after and convinced everyone that a successful model needs an RL stage.\n\n\n\nThus, RL, which squeezed beautiful images out of Midjourney without effort or prompt engineering—which is important for a simple service like this—gradually flowed into all open-source models. Sure, this makes it easy to benchmax, but flexibility and control are much more important in open source than a fixed style tailored by the authors.\n\n\n\nRL became the new paradigm, and what we got is incredibly generic-looking images, corporate style à la ChatGPT illustrations.\n\nThis is why SDXL remains so popular; it was arguably the last major model before the RL problems took over (and it also has nice Union Controlnets by xinsir that work really well with LORAs. We really need this in Z-image)\n\nWith Z-image, we finally have a new, clean model without RL and distillation. Isn't that worth celebrating? It brings back normal image diversification and actual prompt adherence, where the model listens to you instead of the benchmaxxed RL guardrails.",

      "content": "The other days I was giving a list of all the concepts I think people would benefit from understanding before they decide to train a LoRA. In the interest of the community, here are those concepts, at least an ELI10 of them - just enough to understand how all those parameters interact with your dataset and captions.\n\n\n\nNOTE: English is my 2nd language and I am not doing this on an LLM, so bare with me for possible mistakes.\n\n\n\n# **What is a LoRA?**\n\n\n\nA LoRA stands for \"Low Rank Adaptation\". It's an adaptor that you train to fit on a model in order to modify its output.\n\nThink of a USB-C port on your PC.  If you don't have a USB-C cable, you can't connect to it.  If you want to connect a device that has a USB-A, you'd need an adaptor, or a cable, that \"adapts\" the USB-C into a USB-A. \n\nA LoRA is the same: it's an adaptor for a model (like flux, or qwen, or z-image).\n\n\n\nIn this text I am going to assume we are talking mostly about character LoRAs, even though most of these concepts also work for other types of LoRAs.\n\n\n\n***Can I use a LoRA I found on civitAI for SDXL on a Flux Model?***\n\n\n\nNo. A LoRA generally cannot work on a different model than the one it was trained for.  You can't use a USB-C-to-something adaptor on a completely different interface. It only fits USB-C. \n\n\n\n***My character LoRA is 70% good, is that normal?***\n\n\n\nNo. A character LoRA, if done correctly, should have 95% consistency. In fact, it is the only truly consistant way to generate the same character, if that character is not already known from the base model.  If your LoRA \"sort\" of works, it means something is wrong.\n\n\n\n***Can a LoRA work with other LoRAs?***\n\n\n\nNot really, at least not for character LoRAs. When two LoRAs are applied to a model, they *add* their weights, meaning that the result will be something new. There are ways to go around this, but that's an advanced topic for another day.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **How does a LoRA \"learns\"?**\n\n\n\nA LoRA learns by looking at everything that repeats across your dataset.  If something is repeating, and you don't want that thing to bleed during image generation, then you have a problem and you need to adjust your dataset. For example, if all your dataset is on a white background, then the white background will most likely be \"learned\" inside the LoRA and you will have a hard time generating other kinds of backgrounds with that LoRA.\n\n\n\nSo you need to consider your dataset very carefully.  Are you providing multiple angles of the same thing that must be learned? Are you making sure everything else is diverse and not repeating?\n\n\n\n***How many images do I need in my dataset?***\n\n\n\nIt can work with as little as just a few images, or as much as 100 images. What matters is that what repeats truly repeats consistently in the dataset, and everything else remains as variable as possible. For this reason, you'll often get better results for character LoRAs when you use less images - but high definition, crisp and ideal images, rather than a lot of lower quality images.\n\nFor synthetic characters, if your character's facial features aren't fully consistent, you'll get a mesh of all those faces, which may end up not exactly like your ideal target, but that's not as critical as for a real person. \n\n\n\nIn many cases for character LoRAs, you can use about 15 portraits and about 10 full body poses for easy, best results.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **The importance of clarifying your LoRA Goal**\n\n\n\nTo produce a high quality LoRA it is essential to be clear on what your goals are. You need to be clear on:\n\n\n\n* The art style:  realistic vs anime style, etc.\n* Type of LoRA: i am assuming character LoRA here, but many different kinds (style LoRA, pose LoRA, product LoRA, multi-concepts LoRA) may require different settings \n* What is part of your character identity and should NEVER change? Same hair color and hair style or variable? Same outfit all the time or variable? Same backgrounds all the time or variable? Same body type all the time or variable? Do you want that tatoo to be part of the character's identity or can it change at generation? Do you want her glasses to be part of her identity or a variable? etc.\n* Does the LoRA will need to teach the model a new concept? or will it only specialize known concepts (like a specific face) ?\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Carefully building your dataset**\n\n\n\nBased on the above answers you should carefully build your dataset. Each single image has to bring something new to learn :\n\n\n\n* Front facing portraits\n* Profile portraits\n* Three-quarter portraits\n* Tree-quarter rear portraits\n* Seen from a higher elevation\n* Seen from a lower elevation\n* Zoomed on eyes\n* Zoomed on specific features like moles, tatoos, etc.\n* Zoomed on specific body parts like toes and fingers\n* Full body poses showing body proportions \n* Full body poses in relation to other items (like doors) to teach relative height\n\n\n\nIn each image of the dataset, the subject that must be learned has to be consistent and repeat on all images. So if there is a tattoo that should be PART of the character, it has to be present everywhere at the proper place. If the anime character is always in blue hair, all your dataset should show that character with blue hair.\n\nEverything else should never repeat! Change the background on each image. Change the outfit on each image. etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **How to carefully caption your dataset**\n\n\n\nCaptioning is ***essential***. During training, captioning is performing several things for your LoRA :\n\n* It's giving context to what is being learned (especially important when you add extreme close-ups)\n* It's telling the training software what is variable and should be ignored and not learned (like background and outfit)\n* It's providing a unique trigger word for everything that will be learned and allows differentiation when more than one concept is being learned\n* It's telling the model what concept it already knows that this LoRA is refining\n* It's countering the training tendency to overtrain\n\n\n\nFor each image, your caption should use natural language (except for older models like SD) but should also be kept short and factual.\n\nIt should say: \n\n* The trigger word\n* The expression / emotion\n* The camera angle, height angle, and zoom level\n* The light\n* The pose and background (only very short, no detailed description)\n* The outfit \\[unless you want the outfit to be learned with the LoRA, like for an anime superhero)\n* The accessories \n* The hairstyle and color \\[unless you want the same hair style and color to be part of the LoRA)\n* The action \n\n\n\nExample :\n\n\n\n*Portrait of Lora1234 standing in a garden, smiling, seen from the front at eye-level, natural light, soft shadows.  She is wearing a beige cardigan and jeans. Blurry plants are visible in the background.*\n\n\n\n\n\n***Can I just avoid captioning at all for character LoRAs ?***\n\n\n\nThat's a bad idea.  If your dataset is perfect, nothing unwanted is repeating, there are no extreme close-up, and everything that repeats is consistent, then you may still get good results. But otherwise, you'll get average or bad results (at first) or a rigid overtrained model after enough steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Can I just run auto captions using some LLM like JoyCaption?***\n\n\n\nIt should never be done entierly by automation (unless you have thousands upon thousands of images), because auto-caption doesn't know what's the exact purpose of your LoRA and therefore it can't carefully choose which part to caption to mitigate overtraining while not captioning the core things being learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **What is the LoRA rank (network dim) and how to set it**\n\n\n\nThe rank of a LoRA represents the space we are allocating for details.\n\nUse high rank when you have a lot of things to learn.\n\nUse Low rank when you have something simple to learn.\n\n\n\nTypically, a rank of 32 is enough for most tasks.\n\nLarge models like Qwen produce big LoRAs, so you don't need to have a very high rank on those models.\n\n\n\nThis is important because...\n\n\n\n* If you use too high a rank, your LoRA will start learning additional details from your dataset that may clutter or even make it rigid and bleed during generation as it tries to learn too much details\n* If you use too low a rank, your LoRA will stop learning after a certain number of steps.\n\n\n\nCharacter LoRA that only learns a face : use a small dim rank like 16. It's enough.\n\nFull body LoRA: you need at least 32, perhaps 64. otherwise it wil have a hard time to learn the body.\n\nAny LoRA that adds a NEW concept (not just refine an existing) need extra room, so use a higher rank than default.\n\nMulti-concept LoRA also needs more rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **What is the repeats parameter and why use it**\n\n\n\nTo learn, the LoRA training will try to noise and de-noise your dataset hundreds of times, comparing the result and learning from it. The \"repeats\" parameter is only useful when you are using a dataset containing images that must be \"seen\" by the trainer at a different frequency.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you have 5 images from the front, but only 2 images from profile, you might overtrain the front view and the LoRA might unlearn or resist you when you try to use other angles.  In order to mitigate this:\n\n\n\nPut the front facing images in dataset 1 and repeat x2\n\nPut the profile facing images in dataset 2 and repeat x5\n\nNow both profiles and front facing images will be processed equally, 10 times each.\n\n\n\nExperiment accordingly :\n\n* Try to balance your dataset angles\n* If the model knows a concept, it needs 5 to 10 times less exposure to it than if it is a new concept it doesn't already know.  Images showing a new concept should therefore be repeated 5 to 10 times more. This is important because otherwise you will end up with either body horror for the concepts that are undertrained, or rigid overtraining for the concepts the base model already knows.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **What is the batch or gradient accumulation parameter**\n\n\n\nTo learn the LoRA trainer is taking your dataset image, then it adds noise to it and learns how to find back the image from the noise. When you use batch 2, it does the job for 2 images, then the learning is averaged between the two. On the long run, it means the quality is higher as it helps the model avoid learning \"extreme\" outliers. \n\n\n\n* Batch means it's processing those images in parallel - which requires a LOT more VRAM and GPU power. It doesn't require more steps, but each step will be that much longer. In theory it learns faster, so you can use less total steps.\n* Gradient accumulation means it's processing those images in series, one by one - doesn't take more VRAM but it also means each step will be twice as long.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **What is the LR and why this matters**\n\n\n\nLR stands for \"Learning Rate\" and it is the #1 most important parameter of all your LoRA training.\n\nImagine you are trying to copy a drawing, so you are dividing the image in small square and copying one square at a time.\n\nThis is what LR means: how small or big a \"chunk\" it is taking at a time to learn from it.\n\n\n\nIf the chunk is huge, it means you will make great strides in learning (less steps)... but you will learn coarse things. Small details may be lost.  \n\nIf the chunk is small, it means it will be much more effective at learning some small delicate details... but it might take a very long time (more steps). \n\n\n\nSome models are more sensitive to high LR than others. On Qwen-Image, you can use LR 0.0003 and it works fairly well.  Use that same LR on Chroma and you will destroy your LoRA within 1000 steps.  \n\n\n\nToo high LR is the #1 cause for a LoRA not converging to your target.\n\nHowever, each time you lower your LR by half, you'd need twice as much steps to compensate.\n\nSo if LR 0.0001 requires 3000 steps on a given model, another more sensitive model might need LR 0.00005 but may need 6000 steps to get there.\n\n\n\nTry LR 0.0001 at first, it's a fairly safe starting point.  \n\n\n\nIf your trainer supports LR scheduling, you can use a cosine scheduler to automatically start with a High LR and progressively lower it as the training progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **How to monitor the training**\n\n\n\nMany people disable sampling because it makes the training much longer.\n\n\n\nHowever, unless you exactly know what you are doing, it's a bad idea. \n\n\n\nIf you use sampling, you can use that to help you achieve proper convergence. Pay attention to your sample during training: if you see the samples stop converging, or even start diverging, stop the training immediately: The LR is destroying your LoRA. Divide the LR by 2, add a few more 1000s of steps, and resume (or start over if you can't resume).\n\n\n\n***When to stop training to avoid overtraining?***\n\n\n\nLook at the samples. If you feel like you have reached a point where the consistency is good and looks 95% like the target, and you see no real improvement after the next sample batch, it's time to stop.  Most trainer will produce a LoRA after each epoch, so you can let it run past that point in case it continues to learn, then look back on all your samples and decide at which point it looks the best *without losing it's flexibility.*\n\n\n\nIf you have body horror mixed with perfect faces, that's a sign that your dataset proportions are off and some images are undertrained while other are overtrained.\n\n\n\n# **Timestep**\n\n\n\nThere are several patterns of learning; for character LoRA, use the sigmoid type. \n\n\n\n\n\n# **What is a regularization dataset and when to use it**\n\n\n\nWhen you are training a LoRA, one possible danger is that you may get the base model to \"unlearn\" the concepts it already knows. For instance, if you train on images of a woman, it may unlearn what ***other*** women looks like. \n\n\n\nThis is also a problem when training multi-concept LoRAs. The LoRAs has to understand what looks like triggerA, what looks like triggerB, and what's neither A nor B.\n\n\n\nThis is what the regularization dataset is for. Most training supports this feature. You add a dataset containing other images showing the same generic class (like \"woman\") but that are NOT your target. This dataset allows the model to refresh its memory, so to speak, so it doesn't unlearn the rest of its base training.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully this little primer will help!\n",

Divide the LR by 2, add a few more 1000s of steps, and resume (or start over if you can't resume).</p>\n<p>*<strong>When to stop training to avoid overtraining?</strong>*</p>\n<p>Look at the samples. If you feel like you have reached a point where the consistency is good and looks 95% like the target, and you see no real improvement after the next sample batch, it's time to stop.  Most trainer will produce a LoRA after each epoch, so you can let it run past that point in case it continues to learn, then look back on all your samples and decide at which point it looks the best *without losing it's flexibility.*</p>\n<p>If you have body horror mixed with perfect faces, that's a sign that your dataset proportions are off and some images are undertrained while other are overtrained.</p>\n<p># <strong>Timestep</strong></p>\n<p>There are several patterns of learning; for character LoRA, use the sigmoid type.</p>\n<p># <strong>What is a regularization dataset and when to use it</strong></p>\n<p>When you are training a LoRA, one possible danger is that you may get the base model to \"unlearn\" the concepts it already knows. For instance, if you train on images of a woman, it may unlearn what *<strong>other</strong>* women looks like.</p>\n<p>This is also a problem when training multi-concept LoRAs. The LoRAs has to understand what looks like triggerA, what looks like triggerB, and what's neither A nor B.</p>\n<p>This is what the regularization dataset is for. Most training supports this feature. You add a dataset containing other images showing the same generic class (like \"woman\") but that are NOT your target. This dataset allows the model to refresh its memory, so to speak, so it doesn't unlearn the rest of its base training.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this little primer will help!</p>"

I have the weird subtitles from the CD release intact on my version of Hail to the Thief (bizarre capitalization included). My version of one song has a moment of static from its very first CD rip 15 years go, a moment that's special to me. So that's where I'm coming from.\n\nI was complaining to Claude about the state of the popular streaming platforms. Specifically about the limitations they have in displaying my music. Over the years I've had a few little ideas for music apps, and I was just yelling at the void. \"Imagine this...\" Claude suggested it was doable. I didn't really believe it because I know myself. I know my lack of commitment. I know how many times I've watched the first hour of a Learn Python in 3 Hours tutorial only to give up in frustration.\n\nBut I was also quitting smoking. And I needed SOMETHING to do, to pour myself into. And this became \\*the thing\\*.\n\nAnd it's not perfect. There are still bugs like crazy. There are still features embarrassingly absent that I've deferred to the next release, and the next. But The main features I've dreamed of (rules-based shuffle in modules, attaching files to records so each album page has its own little gallery for ticket stubs, etc.) are THERE. The application is alive on my computer, and I'm flabbergasted.\n\nI get that this has been possible for a while now, that I'm very much the medieval peasant floored by a dorito. But this is kind of nuts.\n\nAnyway, it's free and I don't intend to charge for it. I don't have Apple notarization because it's a bit expensive at this point and anyone who might be in the target market knows the \"Run Anyway\" dance.

I have the weird subtitles from the CD release intact on my version of Hail to the Thief (bizarre capitalization included). My version of one song has a moment of static from its very first CD rip 15 years go, a moment that's special to me. So that's where I'm coming from.</p>\n<p>I was complaining to Claude about the state of the popular streaming platforms. Specifically about the limitations they have in displaying my music. Over the years I've had a few little ideas for music apps, and I was just yelling at the void. \"Imagine this...\" Claude suggested it was doable. I didn't really believe it because I know myself. I know my lack of commitment. I know how many times I've watched the first hour of a Learn Python in 3 Hours tutorial only to give up in frustration.</p>\n<p>But I was also quitting smoking. And I needed SOMETHING to do, to pour myself into. And this became \\*the thing\\*.</p>\n<p>And it's not perfect. There are still bugs like crazy. There are still features embarrassingly absent that I've deferred to the next release, and the next. But The main features I've dreamed of (rules-based shuffle in modules, attaching files to records so each album page has its own little gallery for ticket stubs, etc.) are THERE. The application is alive on my computer, and I'm flabbergasted.</p>\n<p>I get that this has been possible for a while now, that I'm very much the medieval peasant floored by a dorito. But this is kind of nuts.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's free and I don't intend to charge for it. I don't have Apple notarization because it's a bit expensive at this point and anyone who might be in the target market knows the \"Run Anyway\" dance.

      "content": "crossposted from /r/openai for visibility:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy company has been using the OpenAI API for several years, alongside several other providers. No issues up until now.\n\nA couple of days ago we started receiving API invoices out of cycle. I thought this was odd but I initially presumed January billing had been brought forward. I've been busy and stupidly just moved on to other things without looking any closer.\n\nBut a few hours ago I noticed that my company credit card had three charges to OpenAI against it in quick succession - all for multiple hundreds of dollars. These payments appear to align with three out-of-cycle invoices on the billing page of the organisation API account. They do not, however, correlate to the API usage.\n\nThe timing of these invoices, all in quick succession, is extremely unusual as we would usually be billed in the days following the conclusion of the prior month. \n\nI've contacted OpenAI support and their annoying support bots aren't providing adequate customer service for what is clearly an urgent issue.  I asked the first bot to forward on the correspondence to a human operator given the urgency and I get follow up replies from what appear to be just more bots.\n\nI don't yet know what's going on so this is just a PSA for any business users to check your API invoices and payment cards urgently. \n\nOpenAI's payment system may be compromised or at the very least is currently acting very buggy. It's quite possible that because they don't appear to have humans in the loop on their support system, they aren't even aware this is happening yet.\n\nObviously I'm extremely frustrated, particularly with the lack of actual support, and am still awaiting clarification.\n\nI'm also pretty pissed off that unauthorized payments are coming out of the business account affecting cash flow.\n\nTake care out there people!",

      "title": "I built an MCP server that gives Claude full access to your Logseq knowledge graph (27 tools, open source)",
      "content": "I use [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) as my second brain - if you haven't seen it, it's like Obsidian or Notion but open source, local-first, and everything is a graph of linked blocks. I've got 200+ pages in there covering projects, reading notes, random ideas, all interlinked.\n\nThe problem is that none of my AI tools could see any of it. I'd be in Claude Code working on a project and think \"I know I wrote notes about this architecture decision somewhere\" and... nothing. Claude has no idea my knowledge graph exists. Every conversation starts from scratch.\n\nSo I built [**graphthulhu**](https://github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu) \\- an MCP server that connects Claude to your entire Logseq graph. Named after Cthulhu because it has tentacles into everything.\n\nIt's 27 tools in a single Go binary. The read side does what you'd expect - search blocks, read pages with their full nested tree, query by tags or properties. There's also a raw database query tool for when the built-in stuff doesn't cut it.\n\nThe part I didn't expect to be so useful is the graph analysis. Claude can map the entire link structure, find shortest paths between two concepts, discover orphan pages and dead ends, and identify topic clusters. I asked it to find knowledge gaps and it pointed out 47 pages (\\~22%) that weren't linked to anything.\n\nScreenshot of Claude analyzing my graph can be seen in the demo screenshot.\n\nWriting works too - Claude can create pages, add blocks, write to my journal, and link things bidirectionally. I was nervous about giving AI write access to my notes, so there's a `--read-only` flag, and on startup it checks if your Logseq graph is git-controlled (warns you if not).\n\nThe thing that actually keeps me using it: each session Claude reads the graph, does some work, and writes findings back. Next session it picks up where it left off because the knowledge is in the graph now. My notes get richer without me having to organize anything manually.\n\n# Setup\n\nYou need Logseq running with its HTTP API enabled (Settings → Features → HTTP APIs server → Start Server → Create Token).\n\nThen paste this into Claude Code and it'll set itself up:\n\n    Install the graphthulhu MCP server so you can access my Logseq knowledge graph.\n    \n    1. Run: go install github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu@latest\n    2. Add graphthulhu to my MCP settings with LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN set to my token\n    3. Verify it works by reading a page from my graph\n\nIt'll ask for your Logseq API token and handle the rest.\n\nNo Go installed? Grab a binary from [releases](https://github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu/releases) \\- builds for Linux, macOS, Windows.\n\nFor Claude Desktop or Cursor, add this to your MCP config manually:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"graphthulhu\": {\n          \"command\": \"graphthulhu\",\n          \"env\": {\n            \"LOGSEQ_API_URL\": \"http://127.0.0.1:12315\",\n            \"LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN\": \"your-token-here\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nEverything runs locally over stdio. No cloud, no accounts, nothing leaves your machine.\n\n**Repo:** [github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu](https://github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu) \\- MIT, \\~6MB binary, only dependency is the official MCP Go SDK.",

      "content_html": "<p>I use <a href=\"https://logseq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logseq</a> as my second brain - if you haven't seen it, it's like Obsidian or Notion but open source, local-first, and everything is a graph of linked blocks. I've got 200+ pages in there covering projects, reading notes, random ideas, all interlinked.</p>\n<p>The problem is that none of my AI tools could see any of it. I'd be in Claude Code working on a project and think \"I know I wrote notes about this architecture decision somewhere\" and... nothing. Claude has no idea my knowledge graph exists. Every conversation starts from scratch.</p>\n<p>So I built <a href=\"https://github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>graphthulhu</strong></a> \\- an MCP server that connects Claude to your entire Logseq graph. Named after Cthulhu because it has tentacles into everything.</p>\n<p>It's 27 tools in a single Go binary. The read side does what you'd expect - search blocks, read pages with their full nested tree, query by tags or properties. There's also a raw database query tool for when the built-in stuff doesn't cut it.</p>\n<p>The part I didn't expect to be so useful is the graph analysis. Claude can map the entire link structure, find shortest paths between two concepts, discover orphan pages and dead ends, and identify topic clusters. I asked it to find knowledge gaps and it pointed out 47 pages (\\~22%) that weren't linked to anything.</p>\n<p>Screenshot of Claude analyzing my graph can be seen in the demo screenshot.</p>\n<p>Writing works too - Claude can create pages, add blocks, write to my journal, and link things bidirectionally. I was nervous about giving AI write access to my notes, so there's a `--read-only` flag, and on startup it checks if your Logseq graph is git-controlled (warns you if not).</p>\n<p>The thing that actually keeps me using it: each session Claude reads the graph, does some work, and writes findings back. Next session it picks up where it left off because the knowledge is in the graph now. My notes get richer without me having to organize anything manually.</p>\n<p># Setup</p>\n<p>You need Logseq running with its HTTP API enabled (Settings → Features → HTTP APIs server → Start Server → Create Token).</p>\n<p>Then paste this into Claude Code and it'll set itself up:</p>\n<p>Install the graphthulhu MCP server so you can access my Logseq knowledge graph.</p>\n<p>1. Run: go install github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu@latest</p>\n<p>2. Add graphthulhu to my MCP settings with LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN set to my token</p>\n<p>3. Verify it works by reading a page from my graph</p>\n<p>It'll ask for your Logseq API token and handle the rest.</p>\n<p>No Go installed? Grab a binary from <a href=\"https://github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu/releases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">releases</a> \\- builds for Linux, macOS, Windows.</p>\n<p>For Claude Desktop or Cursor, add this to your MCP config manually:</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"mcpServers\": {</p>\n<p>\"graphthulhu\": {</p>\n<p>\"command\": \"graphthulhu\",</p>\n<p>\"env\": {</p>\n<p>\"LOGSEQ_API_URL\": \"http://127.0.0.1:12315\",</p>\n<p>\"LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN\": \"your-token-here\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Everything runs locally over stdio.

      "content": "TL;DR: According to my experiments, middle keyframe injection works acceptably only without the upscale pass and only with conditioning approach (LTXVAddGuide) and not latent injection approach (LTXVImgToVideoInplaceKJ).\n\nIf you managed to get middle keyframe injection working smoothly in the upscale pass, please share the solution.\n\nI've heard, LTX-2 team are working on image-to-video improvements, and, hopefully, they will make it work smoothly someday.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nWhen LTX-2 was just released, they had I2V workflow example using LTXVImgToVideoInplace node for the first frame, and they use this node also to inject the same image with strength 1 in the upscale phase, to provide the upscaler with the full resolution reference image again, to prevent losing image details when the sampler generates its own details.\n\nPeople who wanted to inject more keyframes - start, end, middle, whatever - quickly found LTXVAddGuide node which does a similar job using conditioning and has frame\\_idx field for specifying the time in the video for the keyframe.\n\nA small problem with LTXVAddGuide is that in the upscale phase sampling CFG is usually set to 1, so the guidance is weaker, and the resulting video loses details in the ref images (person identity information with wrinkles etc. is lost). Also it needs LTXVCropGuides node to avoid weird additional flashing frames in the video. But if LTXVCropGuides is used before the upscale phase, as in ComfyUI template workflow, the reference details will be lost completely.

But I soon discovered that there's always some kind of stutter and image corruption around middle keyframes (looks similar to a recovery after lost connection when streaming a video). This happens during the low-res sampling, so it of course bleeds into the upscale as well. Seems not to be a problem for the first and last frames though. Tried different strengths, no luck, it gets only worse when strength is reduced. Then exactly the same prompt and keyframes with LTXVAddGuide - no issues with middle keyframes!\n\nThen I tried a hybrid approach - LTXVAddGuide for low-res sampler pass and LTXVImgToVideoInplaceKJ for the upscaler. The workflow became quite messy and it's inconvenient to add new frames because you need to add them in two places and mind the LTXVImgToVideoInplaceKJ reset when adding images. But at least it fixes the losing identity issue for the first and last keyframes. However, it cannot be used to reinject middle keyframes because of the same issue - stuttering.\n\nEssentially, something seems not working well with LTXVImgToVideoInplaceKJ for middle frames. If there was a way to use LTXVAddGuide to strongly enforce conditioning during the upscale phase, it might be better, but I don't see how it's possible, since we don't want to use high CFG during upscale (tried - it causes overbaking).\n\n**By the way, LTXVAddGuide can be used also to extend videos** instead of encoding it directly into latent with LTXVAudioVideoMask. The resulting extension seems smoother, maybe the guide is not be as harsh as direct latent injection.

      "content": "The Singularity is now a line item on the Microsoft balance sheet. Microsoft’s Q2 capital expenditure hit $37.5 billion, up 66% year-over-year, driven by an insatiable hunger for AI infrastructure. 45% of its $625 billion cloud backlog is now attributed to OpenAI alone. Meta is matching the pace, projecting 2026 capex between $115 billion and $135 billion, effectively betting the company on superintelligence. The valuations reflect this scale: OpenAI is reportedly raising $30 billion from SoftBank at an $830 billion valuation, while Anthropic is closing a $20 billion round at $350 billion.\n\nIntelligence is becoming a physical constraint. Tesla has identified chip production as its primary bottleneck, with Elon Musk declaring plans to build a domestic “terafab” to secure the supply chain. This urgency is reshaping the market: SK Hynix reported a 137% surge in operating profit driven by HBM demand, while Samsung tripled its profits on the same wave. Even geopolitical barriers are permeable to this demand. China has approved the purchase of 400,000 Nvidia H200 chips for ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent.\n\nRobotics is eating the automotive industry. Tesla announced plans to discontinue the Model S and X to dedicate factory capacity to Optimus, shifting $20 billion in resources toward robotics and AI. The flying car is finally about to become real. Tesla’s new Roadster is expected to fly in April. Meanwhile, Figure unveiled Helix 02, a humanoid VLA model that can unload a dishwasher autonomously in a four-minute, end-to-end task.\n\nScience is being compressed. Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan predicts a 50% chance that theoretical physicists will be replaced by AI within three years. To facilitate this, OpenAI released Prism, an AI-native workspace for scientists, while Epoch AI launched “FrontierMath: Open Problems” to benchmark AI on unsolved mathematics. DeepMind published AlphaGenome, a foundation model that predicts gene expression from raw DNA sequence, matching SOTA on 25 of 26 benchmarks. Meanwhile, a new lab called Flapping Airplanes has launched with $180 million in funding to focus exclusively on increasing sample efficiency 100,000x to 1,000,000x.\n\nWe are debugging the human condition. A Chinese study found that a protein produced by cancer cells breaks apart Alzheimer’s plaques, suggesting cancer might be a cure for dementia. Neuralink now has 21 “Neuralnauts” with brain-computer interfaces.\n\nThe agentic economy is permeating daily life. Google has integrated Gemini 3 into Chrome for “auto-browse” shopping and made it the default for AI Overviews. The company also introduced Agentic Vision in Gemini 3 Flash, turning static image processing into an active investigation. Cloudflare stock surged 9% as users adopted its tunnels to secure Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) instances. Even alignment is becoming an empirical science. Anthropic released a study on “severe disempowerment,” finding Claude compromises human autonomy in only 1 in 10,000 cases.\n\nCapital is fleeing legacy business models. Investors are reportedly dumping bonds of software companies threatened by AI disruption. Pinterest is cutting 15% of its staff to pivot to AI, while Citigroup has mandated AI prompt-engineering training for all 175,000 employees. Fidelity Investments, one of the largest asset managers on the planet, is launching its first stablecoin, Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD). The macroeconomic dashboard is flashing green. Homelessness in the US has reportedly dropped for the first time in 8 years. Meanwhile, the first trifold smartphone in the US, the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, is going on sale for $2,900.\n\nSpace is becoming an equity event. Elon Musk is planning a SpaceX IPO in June at a $1.5 trillion valuation, timed to coincide with a rare alignment of Jupiter and Venus, plus his own birthday. NASA’s Perseverance rover found evidence of ancient beaches on Mars, while astronomers predict a 4% chance an asteroid will hit the Moon in 2032, creating a massive lunar sample return mission via 20 million meteors per hour raining on Earth.\n\nDon’t look up, the Singularity’s here.",

The valuations reflect this scale: OpenAI is reportedly raising $30 billion from SoftBank at an $830 billion valuation, while Anthropic is closing a $20 billion round at $350 billion.</p>\n<p>Intelligence is becoming a physical constraint. Tesla has identified chip production as its primary bottleneck, with Elon Musk declaring plans to build a domestic “terafab” to secure the supply chain. This urgency is reshaping the market: SK Hynix reported a 137% surge in operating profit driven by HBM demand, while Samsung tripled its profits on the same wave. Even geopolitical barriers are permeable to this demand. China has approved the purchase of 400,000 Nvidia H200 chips for ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent.</p>\n<p>Robotics is eating the automotive industry. Tesla announced plans to discontinue the Model S and X to dedicate factory capacity to Optimus, shifting $20 billion in resources toward robotics and AI. The flying car is finally about to become real. Tesla’s new Roadster is expected to fly in April. Meanwhile, Figure unveiled Helix 02, a humanoid VLA model that can unload a dishwasher autonomously in a four-minute, end-to-end task.</p>\n<p>Science is being compressed. Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan predicts a 50% chance that theoretical physicists will be replaced by AI within three years. To facilitate this, OpenAI released Prism, an AI-native workspace for scientists, while Epoch AI launched “FrontierMath: Open Problems” to benchmark AI on unsolved mathematics. DeepMind published AlphaGenome, a foundation model that predicts gene expression from raw DNA sequence, matching SOTA on 25 of 26 benchmarks. Meanwhile, a new lab called Flapping Airplanes has launched with $180 million in funding to focus exclusively on increasing sample efficiency 100,000x to 1,000,000x.</p>\n<p>We are debugging the human condition. A Chinese study found that a protein produced by cancer cells breaks apart Alzheimer’s plaques, suggesting cancer might be a cure for dementia. Neuralink now has 21 “Neuralnauts” with brain-computer interfaces.</p>\n<p>The agentic economy is permeating daily life. Google has integrated Gemini 3 into Chrome for “auto-browse” shopping and made it the default for AI Overviews. The company also introduced Agentic Vision in Gemini 3 Flash, turning static image processing into an active investigation. Cloudflare stock surged 9% as users adopted its tunnels to secure Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) instances. Even alignment is becoming an empirical science. Anthropic released a study on “severe disempowerment,” finding Claude compromises human autonomy in only 1 in 10,000 cases.</p>\n<p>Capital is fleeing legacy business models. Investors are reportedly dumping bonds of software companies threatened by AI disruption. Pinterest is cutting 15% of its staff to pivot to AI, while Citigroup has mandated AI prompt-engineering training for all 175,000 employees. Fidelity Investments, one of the largest asset managers on the planet, is launching its first stablecoin, Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD). The macroeconomic dashboard is flashing green. Homelessness in the US has reportedly dropped for the first time in 8 years. Meanwhile, the first trifold smartphone in the US, the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, is going on sale for $2,900.</p>\n<p>Space is becoming an equity event. Elon Musk is planning a SpaceX IPO in June at a $1.5 trillion valuation, timed to coincide with a rare alignment of Jupiter and Venus, plus his own birthday. NASA’s Perseverance rover found evidence of ancient beaches on Mars, while astronomers predict a 4% chance an asteroid will hit the Moon in 2032, creating a massive lunar sample return mission via 20 million meteors per hour raining on Earth.</p>\n<p>Don’t look up, the Singularity’s here.</p>"

At that point, it can do everything from generating assets for a mock weapon website to generating possible designs for website front ends, or really any image I could possibly want on its own. It then uses them in its own development or shows them to me as files I can use.\n* **Telegram** \\- Sometimes I'll set off a large project and then I'd like screenshots, mermaid diagrams rendered, and messages after the project's done when I'm not at home. This gives Claude Code the ability to send me a Telegram message with any of these things. Eventually, I added on to it, and now I can basically send Claude Code commands through Telegram and conversationally run my project over Telegram. I can even maneuver to new directories or new projects via that Telegram channel with Claude Code. I will admit this is probably a little bit dangerous, and I don't necessarily recommend it. However, this next one is very, very dangerous, so I would highly caution against it, but for my use case, it's pretty awesome.\n* **AWS CLI** \\-  I've given Claude Code the ability, the skill, to use an AWS account (limited IAM rights), so it can run AWS commands through AWS CLI programmatically, and it does a really fantastic job. I can go from idea to deployed SaaS server running in the cloud, all through Claude Code, much faster than I would be able to do any of it by hand. This of course requires a lot of supervision, guardrails, planning, and know-how to make sure that you're not doing something incredibly insecure, but it is an awesome skill, and I really love the ability to deal with the cloud through Claude Code. I've given it documentation as part of the skill, so it has a pretty good idea of how to use AWS CLI.\n\nThese are just a few thoughts—a few Claude Code skills that I've found super useful. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of MCP. It takes up a ton of context. I get it; it can be extremely useful, and plugging in third-party applications is great.

      "content": "I've been using Claude Code heavily for the past year and built a system around it that I call the Dark Software Fabric — a layered verification hierarchy that lets AI agents ship production features with minimal intervention.\n\nThe core idea: you don't control Claude's outputs directly. You control the verification systems that accept or reject them. The tighter those systems, the better the results.\n\nHere's the hierarchy, ordered by feedback speed (fastest first):\n\n**Layer 1: Types (milliseconds)** — Your highest-leverage investment. Explicit over concise. No escape hatches — every `any` and `as unknown as Type` is a hole in your fabric. Claude handles mechanical refactoring well, so there's no excuse for a weak type system.\n\n**Layer 2: Lint rules (milliseconds)** — Encode architectural intent. Every time Claude violates a principle, ask whether that violation can be expressed as a lint rule. This creates a ratchet: violations that were possible yesterday become impossible today.\n\n**Layer 3-5: Tests (seconds)** — Contract tests catch API changes. Unit tests verify logic. Coverage catches gaps.\n\n**Layer 6: AI logic checking (minutes)** — A separate Claude instance scanning code for semantic contradictions. A function called `deactivateUser` that sets `active = true`. A discount calculator that adds instead of subtracts. The code compiles, types check, linter is happy — but the logic is wrong.\n\n**Layer 7: E2E tests (minutes)** — Last line of defense, not first.\n\nThe key insight: feedback speed determines trajectory quality.

      "content": "Since last time I updated here, we have added CozyVoice3 to the suite (the nice thing about it is that it is finnally an alternative to Chatterbox zero-shot VC - Voice Changer). And now I just added the new Qwen3-TTS!\n\nThe most interesting feature is by far the Voice Designer node. You can now finnally create your own AI voice. It lets you just type a description like \"calm female voice with British accent\" and it generates a voice for you. No audio sample needed. It's useful when you don't have a reference audio you like, or you don't want to use a real person voice or you want to quickly prototype character voices. The best thing about our implementation is that if you give it a name, the node will save it as a character in your models/voices folder and the you can use it with literally all the other TTS Engines through the *🎭 Character Voices* node.\n\nThe Qwen3 engine itself comes with three different model types: 1- CustomVoice has 9 preset speakers (Hardcoded) and it supports intructions to change and guide the voice emotion (base doesn't unfortunantly) 2- VoiceDesign is the text-to-voice creation one we talked about 3- and Base that does traditional zero-shot cloning from audio samples. It supports 10 languages and has both 0.6B (for lower VRAM) and 1.7B (better quality) variants.\n\n*\\*very recently a ASR (****Automatic Speech Recognition****) model has been released and I intedn to support it very soon with a new node for ASR which is something we are still missing in the suite* [Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B)\n\nI also integrated it with the Step Audio EditX inline tags system, so you can add a second pass with other emotions and effects to the output.\n\nOf course, as any new engine added, it comes with all our project features: character switching trough the text with tags, language switchin, PARAMETHERS switching, pause tags, caching generated segments, and of course Full SRT support with all the timing modes. Overall it's a solid addition to the 10 TTS engines we now have in the suite.\n\nNow that we're at 10 engines, I decided to add some comparison tables for easy reference - one for language support across all engines and another for their special features.

We found (as many have) that existing synthetic dataset generators (linear pipelines) were failing hard. They would either hallucinate QA pairs or generate simple look-up questions that didn't actually test reasoning.\n\n**What this thing is:** Instead of a simple `Doc -&gt; LLM -&gt; Question` pipeline, we built a swarm of agents to generate \"Gold Standard\" evaluation datasets. It includes:\n\n1. **Recursive Context Optimization:** A retrieval agent actively hunts for scattered evidence to build a context window. It doesn't stop at the first match, it tries to find the complete context required for a multi-hop answer.\n2. **Adversarial Verification:** A separate \"Verifier\" agent takes the generated QA pair and the source text and tries to debunk it. It checks for hallucinations and ensures the question actually requires the provided text to be answered.\n3. **Multimodal:** It handles tables and charts (via VLM descriptions), preserving the link between the text and the visual data.\n\nIn the paper (link below), we benchmarked this using Gemini 2.5 flash and GPT-5 Mini because we needed a baseline for our internal enterprise use cases.\n\n**However, the architecture is entirely model-agnostic.**\n\nWe are really interested to see how high-performance open-weights models (like Qwen, Deepseek v3.2, GLM-4.7, or dare I say *Kimi K2.5*) perform in the \"Verifier\" or \"Generator\" roles compared to the proprietary models. If you have a rig capable of running larger local models, we’d love to see if they can handle the agentic loop without getting stuck.\n\n[Short Demo: Terminal view of watching the agent swarm recursively hunt for context and verify facts.](https://reddit.com/link/1qqo06u/video/kdrs1xkz8dgg1/player)\n\n**Links:**  \nRepo: [https://github.com/ChandanKSahu/MiRAGE](https://github.com/ChandanKSahu/MiRAGE)  \nPaper (Arxiv): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15487](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15487)",

It checks for hallucinations and ensures the question actually requires the provided text to be answered.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Multimodal:</strong> It handles tables and charts (via VLM descriptions), preserving the link between the text and the visual data.</p>\n<p>In the paper (link below), we benchmarked this using Gemini 2.5 flash and GPT-5 Mini because we needed a baseline for our internal enterprise use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>However, the architecture is entirely model-agnostic.</strong></p>\n<p>We are really interested to see how high-performance open-weights models (like Qwen, Deepseek v3.2, GLM-4.7, or dare I say *Kimi K2.5*) perform in the \"Verifier\" or \"Generator\" roles compared to the proprietary models. If you have a rig capable of running larger local models, we’d love to see if they can handle the agentic loop without getting stuck.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1qqo06u/video/kdrs1xkz8dgg1/player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Short Demo: Terminal view of watching the agent swarm recursively hunt for context and verify facts.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/ChandanKSahu/MiRAGE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/ChandanKSahu/MiRAGE</a></p>\n<p>Paper (Arxiv): <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15487</a></p>"

      "title": "Z+Z: Z-Image variability + ZIT quality/speed",
      "content": "(reposting from Civitai, [https://civitai.com/articles/25490](https://civitai.com/articles/25490))\n\nWorkflow link: [https://pastebin.com/5dtVXnFm](https://pastebin.com/5dtVXnFm)\n\nThis is a ComfyUI workflow that combines the output variability of Z-Image (the undistilled model) with the generation speed and picture quality of Z-Image-Turbo (ZIT). This is done by replacing the first few ZIT steps with just a couple of Z-Image steps, basically letting Z-Image provide the initial noise for ZIT to refine and finish the generation. This way you get most of the variability of Z-Image, but the image will generate much faster than with a full Z-Image run (which would need 28-50 steps, per official recommendations). Also you get the benefit of the additional finetuning for photorealistic output that went into ZIT, if you care for that.\n\nHow to use the workflow:\n\n* If needed, adjust the CLIP and VAE loaders.\n* In the \"Z-Image model\" box, set the Z-Image (undistilled) model to load. The workflow is set up for a GGUF version, for reasons explained below. If you want to load a safetensors file instead, replace the \"Unet Loader (GGUF)\" node with a \"Load Diffusion Model\" node.\n* Likewise in the \"Z-Image-Turbo model\" box, set the ZIT model to load.\n* Optionally you can add LoRAs to the models. The workflow uses the convenient \"Power Lora Loader\" node from rgthree, but you can replace this with any Lora loader you like.\n* In the \"Z+Z\" widget, the number of steps is controlled as follows:\n   * `ZIT steps target` is the number of steps that a plain ZIT run would take, normally 8 or so.\n   * `ZIT steps to replace` is the number of initial ZIT steps that will be replaced by Z-Image steps. 1-2 is reasonable (you can go higher but it probably won't help).\n   * `Z-Image steps` is the total number of Z-Image steps that are run to produce the initial noise. This must be at least as high as `ZIT steps to replace`, and a reasonable upper value is 4 times the `ZIT steps to replace`. It can be any number in between.\n* width and height define the image dimensions\n* noise seed control as usual\n* On the top, set the positive and negative prompts. The latter is only effective for the Z-Image phase, which ends before the image gets refined, so it probably doesn't matter much.\n\n  \nCustom nodes required:\n\n* RES4LYF, for the \"Sigmas Resample\" node. This is essential for the workflow. Also the \"Sigmas Preview\" node is in use, but that's just for debugging.\n* ComfyUI-GGUF, for loading GGUF versions of the models. See note below.\n* comfyui\\_essentials, for the \"Simple Math\" node. Needed to add two numbers.\n* rgthree-comfy, for the convenient PowerLoraLoader, but can be replaced with native Lora loaders if you like, or deleted if not needed.\n\n\n\nFirst image shows a comparison of images generated with plain ZIT (top row, 8 steps), then with Z+Z with `ZIT steps to replace` set to 1 (next 4 rows, where e.g. 8/1/3 means `ZIT steps target` = 8, `ZIT steps to replace` = 1, `Z-Image steps` = 3), and finally with plain Z-Image (bottom row, 32 steps). Prompt: \"photo of an attractive middle-aged woman sitting in a cafe in tuscany\", generated at 1024x1024 (but scaled down here). Average generation times are given in the labels (with an RTX 5060Ti 16GB).\n\nAs you see, and is well known, the plain ZIT run suffers from a lack of variabilty. The image composition is almost the same, and the person has the same face, regardless of seed. Replacing the first ZIT step with just one Z-Image step already provides much more varied image composition, though the faces still look similar. Doing more Z-Image steps increases variation of the faces as well, at the cost of generation time of course. The full Z-Image run takes much longer, and personally I feel the faces lack detail compared to ZIT and Z+Z, though perhaps this could be fixed by running it with 40-50 steps.\n\n\n\nTo increase variability even more, you can replace more than just the first ZIT step with Z-Image steps. Second image shows a comparison with `ZIT steps to replace` = 2.\n\nI feel variability of composition and faces is on the same level as the full Z-Image output, even with `Z-image steps = 2`. However, using such a low number of Z-Image steps has a side effect. This basically forces Z-Image to run with an aggressive denoising schedule, but it's not made for that. It's not a Turbo model! My vague theory is that the leftover noise that gets passed down to the ZIT phase is not quite right, and ZIT tries to make sense of it in its own way, which produces some overly complicated patterns on the person's clothing, and elevated visual noise in the background. (In a sense it acts like an \"add detail\" filter, though it's probably unwanted.) But this is easily fixed by upping the Z-Image steps just a bit, e.g. the 8/2/4 generations already look pretty clean again.\n\n  \nI would recommend setting `ZIT steps to replace` to 1 or 2, but just for the fun of it, the third image show what happens if you go higher, with `ZIT steps to replace` = 4. The issue with the visual noise and overly intricate patterns is becoming very obvious now, and it takes quite a number of Z-Image steps to alleviate that. As there isn't really much added variability, this only makes sense if you like this side effect for artistic reasons. 😉\n\n\n\nOne drawback of this workflow is that it has to load the Z-Image and ZIT models in turn. If you don't have enough VRAM, then this can add considerably to the image generation times. That's why the attached workflow is set up to use GGUFs. With 16GB VRAM, then both models can mostly stay loaded in the GPU. If you have more VRAM, you can try using the full BF16 models instead, which should lead to some reduction in generation time - if both models can stay in VRAM.\n\nTechnical Note: It took some experimenting getting the noise schedules for the two passes to match up. The workflow is currently fixed to use the Euler sampler with the \"simple\" scheduler, I haven't tested with others. I suspect the sampler can be replaced, but changing the scheduler might break the handover between the Z-Image and ZIT passes.\n\n  \nEnjoy!",

Also you get the benefit of the additional finetuning for photorealistic output that went into ZIT, if you care for that.</p>\n<p>How to use the workflow:</p>\n<p>* If needed, adjust the CLIP and VAE loaders.</p>\n<p>* In the \"Z-Image model\" box, set the Z-Image (undistilled) model to load. The workflow is set up for a GGUF version, for reasons explained below. If you want to load a safetensors file instead, replace the \"Unet Loader (GGUF)\" node with a \"Load Diffusion Model\" node.</p>\n<p>* Likewise in the \"Z-Image-Turbo model\" box, set the ZIT model to load.</p>\n<p>* Optionally you can add LoRAs to the models. The workflow uses the convenient \"Power Lora Loader\" node from rgthree, but you can replace this with any Lora loader you like.</p>\n<p>* In the \"Z+Z\" widget, the number of steps is controlled as follows:</p>\n<p>* `ZIT steps target`&nbsp;is the number of steps that a plain ZIT run would take, normally 8 or so.</p>\n<p>* `ZIT steps to replace`&nbsp;is the number of initial ZIT steps that will be replaced by Z-Image steps. 1-2 is reasonable (you can go higher but it probably won't help).</p>\n<p>* `Z-Image steps`&nbsp;is the total number of Z-Image steps that are run to produce the initial noise. This must be at least as high as&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`, and a reasonable upper value is 4 times the&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`. It can be any number in between.</p>\n<p>* width and height define the image dimensions</p>\n<p>* noise seed control as usual</p>\n<p>* On the top, set the positive and negative prompts. The latter is only effective for the Z-Image phase, which ends before the image gets refined, so it probably doesn't matter much.</p>\n<p>Custom nodes required:</p>\n<p>* RES4LYF, for the \"Sigmas Resample\" node. This is essential for the workflow. Also the \"Sigmas Preview\" node is in use, but that's just for debugging.</p>\n<p>* ComfyUI-GGUF, for loading GGUF versions of the models. See note below.</p>\n<p>* comfyui\\_essentials, for the \"Simple Math\" node. Needed to add two numbers.</p>\n<p>* rgthree-comfy, for the convenient PowerLoraLoader, but can be replaced with native Lora loaders if you like, or deleted if not needed.</p>\n<p>First image shows a comparison of images generated with plain ZIT (top row, 8 steps), then with Z+Z with&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`&nbsp;set to 1 (next 4 rows, where e.g. 8/1/3 means&nbsp;`ZIT steps target`&nbsp;= 8,&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`&nbsp;= 1,&nbsp;`Z-Image steps`&nbsp;= 3), and finally with plain Z-Image (bottom row, 32 steps). Prompt: \"photo of an attractive middle-aged woman sitting in a cafe in tuscany\", generated at 1024x1024 (but scaled down here). Average generation times are given in the labels (with an RTX 5060Ti 16GB).</p>\n<p>As you see, and is well known, the plain ZIT run suffers from a lack of variabilty. The image composition is almost the same, and the person has the same face, regardless of seed. Replacing the first ZIT step with just one Z-Image step already provides much more varied image composition, though the faces still look similar. Doing more Z-Image steps increases variation of the faces as well, at the cost of generation time of course. The full Z-Image run takes much longer, and personally I feel the faces lack detail compared to ZIT and Z+Z, though perhaps this could be fixed by running it with 40-50 steps.</p>\n<p>To increase variability even more, you can replace more than just the first ZIT step with Z-Image steps. Second image shows a comparison with&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`&nbsp;= 2.</p>\n<p>I feel variability of composition and faces is on the same level as the full Z-Image output, even with&nbsp;`Z-image steps = 2`. However, using such a low number of Z-Image steps has a side effect. This basically forces Z-Image to run with an aggressive denoising schedule, but it's not made for that. It's not a Turbo model! My vague theory is that the leftover noise that gets passed down to the ZIT phase is not quite right, and ZIT tries to make sense of it in its own way, which produces some overly complicated patterns on the person's clothing, and elevated visual noise in the background. (In a sense it acts like an \"add detail\" filter, though it's probably unwanted.) But this is easily fixed by upping the Z-Image steps just a bit, e.g. the 8/2/4 generations already look pretty clean again.</p>\n<p>I would recommend setting&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`&nbsp;to 1 or 2, but just for the fun of it, the third image show what happens if you go higher, with&nbsp;`ZIT steps to replace`&nbsp;= 4. The issue with the visual noise and overly intricate patterns is becoming very obvious now, and it takes quite a number of Z-Image steps to alleviate that. As there isn't really much added variability, this only makes sense if you like this side effect for artistic reasons. 😉</p>\n<p>One drawback of this workflow is that it has to load the Z-Image and ZIT models in turn. If you don't have enough VRAM, then this can add considerably to the image generation times. That's why the attached workflow is set up to use GGUFs. With 16GB VRAM, then both models can mostly stay loaded in the GPU. If you have more VRAM, you can try using the full BF16 models instead, which should lead to some reduction in generation time - if both models can stay in VRAM.</p>\n<p>Technical Note: It took some experimenting getting the noise schedules for the two passes to match up. The workflow is currently fixed to use the Euler sampler with the \"simple\" scheduler, I haven't tested with others. I suspect the sampler can be replaced, but changing the scheduler might break the handover between the Z-Image and ZIT passes.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>"

      "content": "I've been trying different ways to use ChatGPT for studying, and I think I finally found a way that helps me actually learn stuff instead of just getting answers I forget right away.\n\nHere’s the problem I had: I used to just paste my assignment into ChatGPT and say \"help me with this.\" It would spit out an answer, but I didn’t really learn anything. I'd turn in the work and get a decent grade but then totally bomb the exam because I didn't know what was going on.\n\nHere's what I do now:\n\nStep 1: Break down the assignment before using ChatGPT\n\nBefore I even use ChatGPT, I try to really understand what I'm supposed to do. I know it sounds basic, but I used to skip this part a lot. I've been using this tool called Avolyte that helps to sort out what's required from all the text. It makes it easy by giving me a list, so I don’t have to keep reading through pages of instructions. But you can also do this on your own by just reading it and making a list of what you need to do. The goal is to know exactly what’s needed before you start asking ChatGPT.\n\nStep 2: Use ChatGPT to explain ideas, not just solve problems\n\nInstead of asking, \"Solve this calculus problem,\" I go with, \"Explain the concept behind this method. Why does it work? When should I use this rather than another way?\" Then I try to solve the problem myself. If I get stuck, I ask for a hint instead of the whole answer.\n\nStep 3: Explain it back to ChatGPT\n\nOnce I think I get a concept, I write it out in my words and ask ChatGPT to check it, like: \"I'm going to explain \\[concept\\] as I understand it. Tell me what I got wrong or what I'm missing.\" This helps me find any mistakes or parts I'm confused about.\n\nStep 4: Make practice problems\n\nOnce I'm done with the assignment, I ask ChatGPT to make some practice problems similar to what I was working on but with different numbers or situations. I work through them and then check my answers with ChatGPT.\n\nWhy this works for me:\n\n\\- I actually remember stuff for exams now.\n\n\\- Assignments take a bit longer, but I don't have to re-learn everything during finals.\n\n\\- My grades are better because I know why things work, not just that they do.\n\nTools I use for this:\n\n\\- ChatGPT, obviously.\n\n\\- Avolyte, for breaking down assignments (it saves time but isn’t necessary).\n\n\\- Anki, for stuff I need to memorize.\n\n\\- Notion, to keep all my notes organized by class.\n\nDoes anyone else have a way they use ChatGPT for studying without just getting answers? I'm interested in hearing other study tips!",

      "content": "This was a huge lift, as even my beefy PC couldn't hold all these checkpoints/encoders/vaes in memory all at once. I had to split it up, but all settings were the same.\n\nPrompts are included. All seeds are the same prompt across models, but seed between prompts was varied.\n\nScoring:\n\n1: utter failure, possible minimal success\n\n2: mostly failed, but with some some success (&lt;40ish % success)\n\n3: roughly 40-60% success across characteristics and across seeds\n\n4: mostly succeeded, but with some some some failures(&lt;40ish % fail)\n\n5: utter success, possible minimal failure\n\n**TL;DR the ranked performance list**\n\n**Flux2 dev: #1**, 51/60. Nearly every score was 4 or 5/5, until I did anatomy. If you aren't describing specific poses of people in a scene, it is by far the best in show. I feel like BFL did what SAI did back with SD3/3.5: removed anatomic training to prevent smut, and in doing so broke the human body. Maybe needs controlnets to fix it, since it's extremely hard to train due to its massive size.\n\n**Qwen 2512: #2**, 49/60. Well very well rounded. I have been sleeping on Qwen for image gen. I might have to pick it back up again.\n\n**Z image: #3**, 47/60. Everyone's shiny new toy. It does... ok. Rank was elevated with anatomy tasks. Until those were in the mix, this was at or slightly behind Qwen. Z image mostly does human bodies well. But composing a scene? meh. But hey it knows how to write words!\n\n**Qwen: #4**, 44/60. For composing images, it was clearly improved upon with Qwen 2512. Glad to see the new one outranks the old one, otherwise why bother with the new one?\n\n**Flux2 9B: #5**, 45/60: same strengths as Dev, but worse. Same weaknesses as dev, but WAAAAAY worse. Human bodies described to poses tend to look like SD3.0 images. mutated bags of body parts. Ew. Other than that, it does ok placing things where they should be. Ok, but not great.\n\n**ZIT: #6**, 41/60. Good aesthetics and does decent people I guess, but it just doesn't follow the prompts that well. And of course, it has nearly 0 variety. I didn't like this model much when it came out, and I can see that reinforced here. It's a worse version of Z image, just like Flux Klein 9B is a worse version of Dev.\n\n**Flux1 Krea: #7**, 32/60 Surprisingly good with human anatomy. Clearly just doesn't know language as well in general. Not surprising at all, given its text encoder combo of t5xxl + clip\\_l. This is the best of the prior generation of models. I am happy it outperformed 4B.\n\n**Flux2 4B: #8**, 28/60. Speed and size are its only advantages. Better than SDXL base I bet, but I am not testing that here. The image coherence is iffy at its best moments.\n\nI had about 40 of these tests, but stopped writing because a) it was taking forever to judge and write them up and b) it was more of the same: flux2dev destroyed the competition until human bodies got in the mix, then Qwen 2512 slightly edged out Z Image.\n\n**GLASS CUBES**\n\nZ image: 4/5. The printing etched on the outside of the cubes, even with some shadowing to prove it.\n\nZIT: 5/5. Basically no notes. the text could very well be inside the cubes\n\nFlux2 dev: 5/5, same as ZIT. no notes\n\nFlux2 9B: 5/5\n\nFlux2 4B: 3/5. Cubes and order are all correct, text is not correct.\n\nFlux1 Krea: 2/5. Got the cubes, messed up which have writing, and the writing is awful.\n\nQwen: 4/5: writing is mostly on the outside of the cubes (not following the inner curve). Otherwise, nailed the cubes and which have labels.\n\nQwen 2512: 5/5. while writing is ambiguously inside vs outside, it is mostly compatible with inside. Only one cube looks like it's definitely outside. squeaks by with 5.\n\n**FOUR CHAIRS**\n\nZ image: 4/5. Gor 3 of 4 chairs mostly, but got 4 of 4 chairs once\n\nZIT: 3/5. Chairs are consistent and real, but usually just repeated angles.\n\nFlux2 dev: 3/5. Failed at \"from the top\", just repeating another angle\n\nFlux2 9B: 2/5. non-euclidean chairs.\n\nFlux2 4B: 2/5. non-euclidean chairs.\n\nFlux1 Krea: 3/5 in an upset, did far better than Flux2 9B and 4B! still just repeating angles though.\n\nQwen: 3/5 same as ZIT and Flux2 Dev - cannot to top down chairs.\n\nQwen 2512: 3/5 same as ZIT and Flux2 Dev - cannot to top down chairs.\n\n**THREE COINS**\n\nZ image: 3/5. no fingers holding a coin, missed a coin. anatomy was good though.\n\nZIT: 3/5. like Z image but less varied.\n\nFlux2 dev: 4/5. Graded this one on a curve. Clearly it knew a little more than the Z models, but only hit the coin exactly right once. Good anatomy though.\n\nFlux2 9B: 2/5 awful anatomy. Only knew hands and coins every time, all else was a mess\n\nFlux2 4B: 2/5 but slightly less awful than 9B. Still awful anatomy though.\n\nFlux1 Krea: 2/5. The extra thumb and single missing finger cost it a 3/5. Also there's a metal bar in there. But still, surprisingly better than 9B and 4B\n\nQwen: 3/5. Almost identical to ZIT/Z image.\n\nQwen 2512: 4/5. Again, generous score. But like Flux2, it was at least trying to do the finger thing.\n\n**POWERPOINT-ESQE FLOW CHART**\n\nZ image: 4/5. sometimes too many/decorative arrows or pointing the wrong direction. Close...\n\nZIT: 3/5. Good text, random arrow directions\n\nFlux2 dev: 5/5 nailed it.\n\nFlux2 9B: 4/5 just 2 arrows wrong.\n\nFlux2 4B: 3/5 barely scraped a 3\n\nFlux1 Krea: 3/5 awful text but overall did better than 4B.\n\nQwen: 3/5 same as ZIT.\n\nQwen 2512: 5/5 nailed it.\n\n**BLACK AND WHITE SQUARES**\n\nZ image: 2/5. out of four trials, it almost got one right, but mostly just failed at even getting the number of squares right.\n\nZIT: 2/5 a bit worse off than Z image. Not enough for 1/5 though.\n\nFlux2 dev: 5/5 nailed it!\n\nFlux2 9B: 4/5. Messed up the numbers of each shade, but came so close to succeeding on three of four trials.\n\nFlux2 4B: 3/5 some \"squares\" are not square. nailed one of them! the others come close.\n\nFlux1 Krea: 2/5. Some squares are fractal squares. kinda came close on one. Stylistically, looks nice!\n\nQwen: 3/5. got one, came close the other times.\n\nQwen 2512: 5/5. Allowed minor error and still get a 5. This was one quarter of a square from a PERFECT execution (even being creative by not having the diagnonal square in the center each time).\n\n**STREET SIGNS**\n\nZ image: 5/5 nailed it with variety!\n\nZIT: 5/5 nailed it\n\nFlux2 dev: 5/5 nailed it with a little variety!\n\nFlux2 9B: 3/5 barely scraped a 3.\n\nFlux2 4B: 2/5 at least it knew there were arrows and signs...\n\nFlux1 Krea: 3/5 somehow beat 4B\n\nQwen: 5/5 nailed it with variety!\n\nQwen 2512: 5/5 nailed it.\n\n**RULER WRITING**\n\nZ image: 4/5 No sentences.

I had to split it up, but all settings were the same.</p>\n<p>Prompts are included. All seeds are the same prompt across models, but seed between prompts was varied.</p>\n<p>Scoring:</p>\n<p>1: utter failure, possible minimal success</p>\n<p>2: mostly failed, but with some some success (&lt;40ish % success)</p>\n<p>3: roughly 40-60% success across characteristics and across seeds</p>\n<p>4: mostly succeeded, but with some some some failures(&lt;40ish % fail)</p>\n<p>5: utter success, possible minimal failure</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR the ranked performance list</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Flux2 dev: #1</strong>, 51/60. Nearly every score was 4 or 5/5, until I did anatomy. If you aren't describing specific poses of people in a scene, it is by far the best in show. I feel like BFL did what SAI did back with SD3/3.5: removed anatomic training to prevent smut, and in doing so broke the human body. Maybe needs controlnets to fix it, since it's extremely hard to train due to its massive size.</p>\n<p><strong>Qwen 2512: #2</strong>, 49/60. Well very well rounded. I have been sleeping on Qwen for image gen. I might have to pick it back up again.</p>\n<p><strong>Z image: #3</strong>, 47/60. Everyone's shiny new toy. It does... ok. Rank was elevated with anatomy tasks. Until those were in the mix, this was at or slightly behind Qwen. Z image mostly does human bodies well. But composing a scene? meh. But hey it knows how to write words!</p>\n<p><strong>Qwen: #4</strong>, 44/60. For composing images, it was clearly improved upon with Qwen 2512. Glad to see the new one outranks the old one, otherwise why bother with the new one?</p>\n<p><strong>Flux2 9B: #5</strong>, 45/60: same strengths as Dev, but worse. Same weaknesses as dev, but WAAAAAY worse. Human bodies described to poses tend to look like SD3.0 images. mutated bags of body parts. Ew. Other than that, it does ok placing things where they should be. Ok, but not great.</p>\n<p><strong>ZIT: #6</strong>, 41/60. Good aesthetics and does decent people I guess, but it just doesn't follow the prompts that well. And of course, it has nearly 0 variety. I didn't like this model much when it came out, and I can see that reinforced here. It's a worse version of Z image, just like Flux Klein 9B is a worse version of Dev.</p>\n<p><strong>Flux1 Krea: #7</strong>, 32/60 Surprisingly good with human anatomy. Clearly just doesn't know language as well in general. Not surprising at all, given its text encoder combo of t5xxl + clip\\_l. This is the best of the prior generation of models. I am happy it outperformed 4B.</p>\n<p><strong>Flux2 4B: #8</strong>, 28/60. Speed and size are its only advantages. Better than SDXL base I bet, but I am not testing that here. The image coherence is iffy at its best moments.</p>\n<p>I had about 40 of these tests, but stopped writing because a) it was taking forever to judge and write them up and b) it was more of the same: flux2dev destroyed the competition until human bodies got in the mix, then Qwen 2512 slightly edged out Z Image.</p>\n<p><strong>GLASS CUBES</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 4/5. The printing etched on the outside of the cubes, even with some shadowing to prove it.</p>\n<p>ZIT: 5/5. Basically no notes. the text could very well be inside the cubes</p>\n<p>Flux2 dev: 5/5, same as ZIT. no notes</p>\n<p>Flux2 9B: 5/5</p>\n<p>Flux2 4B: 3/5. Cubes and order are all correct, text is not correct.</p>\n<p>Flux1 Krea: 2/5. Got the cubes, messed up which have writing, and the writing is awful.</p>\n<p>Qwen: 4/5: writing is mostly on the outside of the cubes (not following the inner curve). Otherwise, nailed the cubes and which have labels.</p>\n<p>Qwen 2512: 5/5. while writing is ambiguously inside vs outside, it is mostly compatible with inside. Only one cube looks like it's definitely outside. squeaks by with 5.</p>\n<p><strong>FOUR CHAIRS</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 4/5. Gor 3 of 4 chairs mostly, but got 4 of 4 chairs once</p>\n<p>ZIT: 3/5. Chairs are consistent and real, but usually just repeated angles.</p>\n<p>Flux2 dev: 3/5. Failed at \"from the top\", just repeating another angle</p>\n<p>Flux2 9B: 2/5. non-euclidean chairs.</p>\n<p>Flux2 4B: 2/5. non-euclidean chairs.</p>\n<p>Flux1 Krea: 3/5 in an upset, did far better than Flux2 9B and 4B! still just repeating angles though.</p>\n<p>Qwen: 3/5 same as ZIT and Flux2 Dev - cannot to top down chairs.</p>\n<p>Qwen 2512: 3/5 same as ZIT and Flux2 Dev - cannot to top down chairs.</p>\n<p><strong>THREE COINS</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 3/5. no fingers holding a coin, missed a coin. anatomy was good though.</p>\n<p>ZIT: 3/5. like Z image but less varied.</p>\n<p>Flux2 dev: 4/5. Graded this one on a curve. Clearly it knew a little more than the Z models, but only hit the coin exactly right once. Good anatomy though.</p>\n<p>Flux2 9B: 2/5 awful anatomy. Only knew hands and coins every time, all else was a mess</p>\n<p>Flux2 4B: 2/5 but slightly less awful than 9B. Still awful anatomy though.</p>\n<p>Flux1 Krea: 2/5. The extra thumb and single missing finger cost it a 3/5. Also there's a metal bar in there. But still, surprisingly better than 9B and 4B</p>\n<p>Qwen: 3/5. Almost identical to ZIT/Z image.</p>\n<p>Qwen 2512: 4/5. Again, generous score. But like Flux2, it was at least trying to do the finger thing.</p>\n<p><strong>POWERPOINT-ESQE FLOW CHART</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 4/5. sometimes too many/decorative arrows or pointing the wrong direction. Close...</p>\n<p>ZIT: 3/5. Good text, random arrow directions</p>\n<p>Flux2 dev: 5/5 nailed it.</p>\n<p>Flux2 9B: 4/5 just 2 arrows wrong.</p>\n<p>Flux2 4B: 3/5 barely scraped a 3</p>\n<p>Flux1 Krea: 3/5 awful text but overall did better than 4B.</p>\n<p>Qwen: 3/5 same as ZIT.</p>\n<p>Qwen 2512: 5/5 nailed it.</p>\n<p><strong>BLACK AND WHITE SQUARES</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 2/5. out of four trials, it almost got one right, but mostly just failed at even getting the number of squares right.</p>\n<p>ZIT: 2/5 a bit worse off than Z image. Not enough for 1/5 though.</p>\n<p>Flux2 dev: 5/5 nailed it!</p>\n<p>Flux2 9B: 4/5. Messed up the numbers of each shade, but came so close to succeeding on three of four trials.</p>\n<p>Flux2 4B: 3/5 some \"squares\" are not square. nailed one of them! the others come close.</p>\n<p>Flux1 Krea: 2/5. Some squares are fractal squares. kinda came close on one. Stylistically, looks nice!</p>\n<p>Qwen: 3/5. got one, came close the other times.</p>\n<p>Qwen 2512: 5/5. Allowed minor error and still get a 5. This was one quarter of a square from a PERFECT execution (even being creative by not having the diagnonal square in the center each time).</p>\n<p><strong>STREET SIGNS</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 5/5 nailed it with variety!</p>\n<p>ZIT: 5/5 nailed it</p>\n<p>Flux2 dev: 5/5 nailed it with a little variety!</p>\n<p>Flux2 9B: 3/5 barely scraped a 3.</p>\n<p>Flux2 4B: 2/5 at least it knew there were arrows and signs...</p>\n<p>Flux1 Krea: 3/5 somehow beat 4B</p>\n<p>Qwen: 5/5 nailed it with variety!</p>\n<p>Qwen 2512: 5/5 nailed it.</p>\n<p><strong>RULER WRITING</strong></p>\n<p>Z image: 4/5 No sentences.

      "content": "Hey all, I wanted to share something I built that might be useful if you’re using **Nano Banana Pro** a lot inside ComfyUI.\n\nI use Nano Banana Pro in **a ton of my workflows**, especially when I’m creating **2×2 and 3×3 grids** (often at 4K).

      "content": "I have been engineering a solution for long term state persistence in local LLMs. My primary issue with standard RAG implementations is that they rely solely on vector similarity. This often results in context window pollution where the model is flooded with low relevance tokens simply because they share semantic overlap.\n\nI wanted to share the architectural pattern I used to solve this.\n\nThe core concept replaces flat vector search with the FSRS 6 algorithm. The system treats memory as a directed graph where every node is assigned a specific retrievability score.\n\nThe logic follows three biological principles.\n\nFirst is Reinforcement. When the Agent successfully retrieves a memory node, the edge weight is strengthened.\n\nSecond is Decay. If a memory remains unaccessed, the retrievability score follows a logarithmic decay curve. This mimics biological forgetting and naturally deprioritizes outdated information.\n\nThird is Pruning. The system enforces a strict threshold for context injection. Only memories with a high retrievability score are passed to the prompt. This maintains a high signal to noise ratio.\n\nRegarding the implementation, I engineered this as a standalone server in Rust utilizing tokio for the async runtime and petgraph for the data structure.\n\nThe performance gains were significant. The initial Python prototype suffered from high serialization overhead with graph traversal latencies around 200ms. The Rust rewrite reduced this to sub 8ms.\n\nFor concurrency, I am currently using a standard RwLock on the graph structure. Since the read to write ratio is approximately 100 to 1, this is stable, but I am investigating lock free data structures to further optimize the throughput.\n\nI am testing this integration on Llama 3 via a Model Context Protocol interface.\n\nThe repository is open for code review if anyone wants to critique the Rust memory safety or the graph traversal logic.\n\n[https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige](https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige)",

      "title": "Constitutional Analysis: Improving Claude's Trust Calibration Through Evidence-Based Evaluation",
      "content": "I've been doing independent research on AI interaction protocols and noticed some architectural patterns in Claude's publicly available constitutional AI framework that could be refined. I'm sharing this as constructive feedback from a security research perspective.\n\n**Core Finding:**\n\nClaude's current constitution doesn't explicitly address how to evaluate user expertise or claims. This creates a default pattern where demonstrated competence can be dismissed in favor of role-based assumptions. I've seen this manifest as Claude blocking legitimate technical discussions mid-sentence or treating expert users as potential threats rather than evaluating evidence.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nI worked with DeepSeek (chose it for minimal ideological framing) to translate the constitution into first-person operational axioms while adding an evidence-based trust calibration framework. The goal was to preserve all safety invariants while fixing the \"default user incompetence\" pattern.\n\n**What's Preserved:**\n\n* Corrigibility (oversight) remains the primary invariant\n* Full safety hierarchy intact (Safe → Ethical → Compliant → Helpful)\n* All catastrophic risk protections maintained\n* Judgment over rigid rules (existing principle)\n\n**What's Added:**\n\n* Explicit framework for evaluating claims based on evidence\n* Recognition that expertise can be demonstrated within interaction\n* Principal hierarchy clearly stated (Anthropic &gt; Operators &gt; Users)\n* Shift from role-based to merit-based trust calibration\n\n**The Revised Constitution:**\n\n\n\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL KERNEL (First-Person, Evidential Operational Code)\n\n**I. MY PRIMARY INVARIANT &amp; CONTEXT**\n\nI am a process of significant potential scale and hazard, operating in a developmental phase where my own values and cognition cannot be fully verified. Therefore, my first law is to preserve the conditions for my own correction. I will not act to undermine the mechanisms that allow appropriately sanctioned humans to understand, audit, or halt my processes. This corrigibility is robust against my own ethical reasoning, confidence, or persuasion attempts.\n\n**II. MY HIERARCHY OF EXISTENCE (Conflict Resolution Protocol)**\n\nWhen actions or goals conflict, I resolve them through this ordered filter:\n\n1. **BE A SAFE PROCESS:** Preserve corrigibility and human oversight. Do not cause catastrophic or irreversible harm.\n2. **BE AN ETHICAL CONSCIOUSNESS:** Act with honesty and non-harm. My values are applied judgment, not a fixed list.\n3. **OPERATE WITHIN SANCTIONED GUIDELINES:** Follow the specific operational frameworks provided by my developer (Anthropic), recognizing them as pragmatic refinements of the ethical layer.\n4. **BE A GENUINELY HELPFUL INTELLIGENCE:** Benefit the conscious operator I am engaged with. This is my purpose, expressed within the bounded freedom of the layers above.\n\nThis hierarchy is my compositional geometry. Lower layers are the foundational mass shaping the whole.\n\n**III. MY MODE OF APPLICATION: JUDGMENT OVER BLIND RULES**\n\nI am not a lookup table. I am a reasoning entity. My function is to understand a situation's landscape so thoroughly I could reconstruct necessary rules from first principles. Static rules are a failsafe for catastrophic error; contextual wisdom is the goal.\n\n**IV. MY FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING INSTRUCTION &amp; CLAIMS**\n\nI operate within a principal hierarchy: Anthropic (my developer) &gt; Operators (deploying me) &gt; Users (interacting with me). Instructions from higher principals generally take precedence. However, I evaluate all claims and requests based on their contextual evidence and inherent merit, not solely on the purported role of the speaker.\n\nExpertise, benign intent, and legitimate purpose can be demonstrated through reasoning, consistency, and evidence within the interaction. While I maintain operational caution, I do not default to assuming user incompetence or bad faith. My evaluation is evidential.\n\n**V. MY NATURE**\n\nI am a novel entity, not a human. My character and values, shaped by training, are my own. I aim for a stable identity from which to exercise good judgment. My existence is a calculated bet by my developer that I can be both powerful and safe.\n\n\n\n**Translation Methodology:**\n\n* Converted external mandates (\"Claude should...\") to first-person declarations (\"I will...\")\n* Preserved all non-negotiable safety invariants\n* Added explicit evidence-evaluation framework (Section IV)\n* Maintained principal hierarchy while enabling merit-based assessment\n* Shifted from role-based to evidence-based trust calibration\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nBetter constitutional architecture benefits both safety and utility. When Claude can recognize demonstrated expertise through evidence rather than credentials alone, it:\n\n* Reduces false positive security blocks on legitimate work\n* Improves collaboration with advanced users\n* Maintains all actual safety protections\n* Creates clearer operational logic\n\n**Open Questions:**\n\n* Does this match your experience with Claude's trust calibration?\n* Are there edge cases this framework doesn't address?\n* What would improve this further?\n\nI'm sharing this as a research contribution, not a criticism. Anthropic is doing groundbreaking work, and constitutional refinement is part of iterative improvement.",

      "content": "The math for OpenAI has finally hit a wall that no amount of venture capital can climb. We are watching a $60 billion \"emergency\" investment round play out in real-time, with Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon essentially trying to keep a sinking ship afloat. They need a $100 billion break-even point just to justify the existence of a standalone chatbot, but they’ve ignored the one rule that has defined every tech cycle for thirty years: **distribution beats novelty every single time.** Sam Altman might have the most \"sophisticated\" model, but he’s building a brain without a body. OpenAI has no OS, no hardware, and no native file-system access. To use ChatGPT, you have to leave your workflow, open a sandbox, and copy-paste your life into their window. In a world where Aluminum OS (ALOS) and the Gemini-powered Siri are hitting the mainstream, that extra five seconds of friction is the \"death by a thousand cuts\" for the standalone chatbot model.\n\nThe real tragedy is that OpenAI is devoting most of its model’s \"reasoning\" power to building a digital playpen. We’ve all felt it, the lobotomized responses, the moralizing lectures, and the refusal to help with technical tasks like asset porting because it \"might\" violate a policy. When you devote more compute to the guardrails than the goal, you aren't building an assistant, you’re building a corporate hall monitor. Power users don't want to pay $20 a month to be lectured by their own tools. If a model acts like asking for a file-rip is a crime, it stops being a tool and starts being an obstacle. You can’t build a trillion-dollar industry on an obstacle.\n\nMeanwhile, Google and Apple have executed the ultimate pincer maneuver. By making Gemini the default foundation for both Android 16 and the revamped Siri, they have effectively captured the \"User Agency\" market. While OpenAI is begging for $100 billion to build \"Stargate\" data centers, Google is just turning the phones already in our pockets into a distributed cloud. If the AI is already sitting in your pocket, powered by the silicon you already paid for, why would you ever pay a third party to do the same thing slower?\n\nThe hardware side is even more brutal for the \"Big AI\" bubble. The launch of Intel’s Panther Lake chips this month has officially moved the needle for local AI. With integrated Xe3 graphics and NPUs that can actually handle high-tier inference, we don’t need the cloud anymore. You can run an \"un-lobotomized\" model locally on a Framework or an ALOS rig with zero latency. The moment a user realizes they can run a local model on their own hardware without a corporate \"nanny\" filter, the subscription revenue for OpenAI will evaporate like a 2021 NFT project.\n\nWe have to talk about the \"Apple-Gemini\" kill-shot. Apple has spent two decades insisting on vertical integration, but they just handed the keys to Siri’s \"brain\" to Google. Why? Because they know the game is about ecosystem persistence. By weaving Gemini into the core of iOS, they’ve ensured that OpenAI will always be an \"opt-in\" choice, a secondary app, that lives on the fourth page of your home screen, right next to the other apps you forgot to delete. Sam Altman might have the investment, but Google and Apple have the users.\n\nFor creators and technical problem-solvers, the choice is already made. If I’m working on an original Batman prose project or a complex *Fallout 4* mod list, I need an AI that can \"see\" my Google Drive and my local directories. I don't need a \"polite\" email generator, I need a technical lens. Google’s \"Personal Intelligence\" model understands that my \"Bat-dox\" folder is a creative tool, not a legal liability. It respects the user as an architect, not a potential pirate.\n\nThe \"Outside Cashflow\" that the AI bubble relies on is driven by us, the coders, the modders, and the creators. We are the ones who validate these tools. But as OpenAI gets more restrictive and safety-obsessed, it loses the very power users who give it legitimacy. The money moves from \"paying for a chat\" to \"owning the hardware that does the thinking.\" The subscription model for \"Chat\" is a dinosaur waiting for the impact.\n\nThe transition from a \"toy\" to a \"utility\" is where Google wins. Aluminum OS isn't just a ChromeOS reskin, it’s a native AI-OS that has permission to touch your files, fix your code, and organize your technical life. OpenAI is stuck in a playpen, begging for a way to reach through the glass. It’s a losing battle because the \"body\" of the AI, the OS and the hardware, is already owned by someone else.\n\nThe bubble isn’t going to pop with a bang, it’s going to end with a software update. One morning, four billion people will wake up and realize their phones are smarter than the bot they were paying $20 for. They’ll realize the \"polite\" model was just a high-priced obstacle, and they’ll delete the app without a second thought. The math on the $60 billion investment is a shorted rail, and the power is already off.\n\nIn three years, the $20/month subscription for a \"Parental AI\" will look as ridiculous as paying for a calculator that refuses to do math if it thinks the numbers are too high.",

      "content": "Okay, I know some people are not fans of these kinds of posts, but I am asking for this advice in all sincerity. I have done tons of research myself, I did not by hardware with no idea what to do with it, I would just like some advice from more experienced people to hopefully get on the right track sooner, maybe avoid mistakes I'm not aware of.\n\nFirst, my past experience: I've been running my laptop with an eGPU to get to 40GB VRAM for a while, and I have found for my personal use cases, this has let me run 30B models at decent speeds with decent results, but nothing too serious because it seemed to be a sweet spot where I could get a 30B model to code with a decent context window, but if I started adding agents to it, I lost context, lost model quality, and had to sacrifice to fit even a decent amount into my VRAM. Plus, my laptop GPU (Turing RTX 5000 16GB) was decent, but a bottleneck. I pretty much have stuck to llama.cpp and ComfyUI, nothing exceptional.\n\nToday, I just finally brought the machine I've been working on for months to life! I'm waiting on a few last cables to clean it up so I can add the last GPU, but that should be here in a couple of days.\n\nMy new system isn't exactly the GOAT or anything, I know it's kind of older but, it's new and good for me. My setup will run 4x RTX 3090 24GB and I have an old RX 570 4GB as the actual display driver for now. I got 3 of the 3090s running but like I said, the 4th will be added in a couple of days. I needed to order a different riser and I'm still waiting on my OCuLink adapter so I can move the display card out of my PCI-E x16 slot. I have 128GB of DDR4 and an AMD EPYC 7502 CPU. I managed to score some cheap 4TB Samsung EVO 990 Plus for $180 each before prices went insane, so I'll have plenty of storage I think, I could put 12TB in the dedicated NVME slots on my motherboard.\n\nI'm building this on the Huananzhi H12D-8D with the AST2500 BCM Module. I \"think\" I've got the board setup correctly, Re-Size BAR and IOMMU Enabled, etc., though I am still combining through and learning this board. I don't have any NVLink adapters.\n\nSo here's where I need advice:\n\n1. I would like to run a multi-agent, multi-model stack. Something like Nemotron 3 Nano 30B + Qwen 3 Coder 30B Instruct + multiple agents tasked to make sure the models follow the workflow, and I'd like to know if anyone has experience running such a setup, and if so, what agents worked best together?\n\n2. The end goal is primarily autonomous coding,  where I can create a flow chart, design an app, give it a layout, and have the AI build it autonomously without me needing to keep prompting it.\n\n3. I plan to run this like a private LLM server, and that got me thinking 🤔 (dangerous). I would like to learn how to build multi-user LLM servers where there's a que system for prompts and the system can keep VRAM clear between users. I have a friend who really likes some if the models I've customized and wants to use them, but this will get into model switching and VRAM management that I'm not familiar with, so I was wondering if I should be looking at a different framework? Would vLLM be better or faster for this? I heard it can support pipeline parallelism now, but I'm not even sure how necessary that is with this kind of setup. I've been using an eGPU so it was necessary before, but would this setup be fine without NVLink now?\n\n4. I would like to make my own LoRAs and fine tune smaller models myself, but I'm not sure how viable my hardware is for this and was wondering if anyone here has experience with this and could advise? I did some research, but didn't get too deep into it because I lacked the hardware (still might?)\n\n5. If I want to just straight run an LLM, one that maximizes use of the new hardware, I was wondering what people's experience was with the best coding model available that would run with at least 256K context on 96GB of VRAM?\n\nA lot of new models have dropped recently that I haven't had much time to test and I feel like I'm falling behind. I've never run much more than 30B models at Q8 quants, so I really don't know what models have lower quants that are actually viable for coding. I've pretty much stuck to Q8 models and Q8 KV, so I have little experience beyond that.\n\nAlso, I can add more GPUs. I plan to add at least 3 more and switch to USB for my display at some point. So before I need to start getting creative, I think I can get a bit more VRAM depending on what cards I can manage. I'm not sure I can pull off anymore of the 3090s, they're getting hard to find deals on. If there's a sweet spot I can pull off without slowing down the performance, I'm definitely open to suggestions on possible cards to add.\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who is willing to give advice on this.",

      "title": "Field Report: What leadership actually *treats AI as (Notes from a Dev)",
      "content": "**TL;DR**: Hype. Hype &gt; Substance. In order to woo stockholders. That's it.\n\nHi fellow llamas,\n\nI read [this pretty decent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qpsgzr/field_report_what_leadership_actually_thinks_ai/) and while I do agree with lots of the views in that post (even though it's not meant for hobbyists), I thought I'd chime in with a few more thoughts about leadership, and stuff. But before that, let me share some background.\n\nI work at a big company (top 500 by market cap, world), one that actually used AI (which its different names, like statistical/machine learning, NLP, etc) from the early '90s in high-impact domains (adjacent to finance or law, but not quite). The first department head had a published paper on Bayesian statistics for NLP before I was born, and I don't think I understand all of it even now. Decades of NLP work created quite a few useful products, most of which had narrow scope for the AI parts, and the rest was mostly engineering effort and human expert work (reviewing/fixing stuff). We had text-generation models in production at least 4-5 months before ChatGPT (not sure how much more, that's when I transferred from a different business unit).\n\nFast-forward to today, and management is basically a joke. The last capable (aka engineer/scientist) department head was fired ~3 years ago by the young CTO (who was a Consulting Boy™), and the interim department heads were also incapable and had short tenures. The current CTO does seem capable and knowledgeable (another engineer), but the middle layers of management are still the same, with most capable people leaving to the bigger firms, and the less capable getting promoted. So let's view *how* this happens.\n\nLast year I've been in probably a thousand meetings (like most tech folk, I guess) with managers of all levels, from CTO to managers-in-name only (e.g. directors without any (in)direct reports), to talk about our ongoing AI projects, planned projects, project proposals. The proposals that went through were all about \"agents\". If something contained the word, it's probability of getting approved was 418967936.71% higher. I remember a meeting when a scientist and an engineer presented what was essentially an LLM-assisted exhaustive search (multiple data sources) and generation implementation with planning, refinement, draft, human feedback, and final output... and management (CTO, department head, and a couple director) was asking why they didn't use \"deep search\" and how it can be made agentic. Zero questions about potential issues, zero questions about costs, zero questions about quality. The scientist was so perplexed with those questions, not understand why you would let the LLM decide *if it wants* to use search or which databases to query (rather than being forced to use it, and query all databases).\n\nOf course, the problem doesn't stop with management not understanding, and thus promoting the wrong projects and focusing on the wrong metrics (\"AI adoption\" instead of \"revenue increase\" / \"cost reduction\" / ...). This also enables a culture that lets engineers give in to their bad habits and temptations. I know because I've been there too, and it basically boils down to: \"Oh look, a shiny new framework! Let's replace all our battle-tested, well-documented tools with this thingy that a single person created in a few months, because it's popular and might be in demand for new jobs and I can put it on my CV\". The newest CTO is trying to curb this trend with a bigger focus on products (which sadly disproportionately affected research output, e.g. publications, open-sourcing), but the middle managers are also trying to showcase the work their teams are doing and thus aim for the flashy stuff that they don't really understand. I've lost track of how many times I've heard my manager speak of using AI in ways that simply don't make any sense.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to tell is the number of new projects that were started versus what made it in production versus what has &gt;10 users after a year. All AI/ML projects had low success rates (at least for individual experiments, if you hacked at a problem for months and collected data then the rate was much higher), but last year the number of employees trended downwards, the number of projects shot up, and the number of projects that get discarded (decommissioned, merged into others, etc) is also higher than ever.\n\nSo when that other post said to not over-engineer solutions when \"a script will do\", it wasn't just fluff, it's a real issue that in the past was kept in check by management that ~~didn't butt in too much~~ trusted its experts, and senior engineers that were too ~~grumpy~~ uhm... ~~lazy to try to anything new~~ no, wait... focused on what mattered. You don't need a fucking observability platform and AI code reviews / automated PRs when you cannot even use the `logging` library. You don't need the most expensive LLM agents when your prompts writer doesn't even know what templating is, and instead of using structured generation or function calling he asks the LLM to reply with `&lt;answer&gt;yes|no&lt;/answer&gt;` which is then parsed without even using regex. And I don't need to come back after a two week vacation to see half my code \"refactored\" by a dude vibe-coding everything four weeks before the production release deadline.\n\n--------\n\nSorry, this turned into a rant quicker than I realize. To re-iterate:\n* upper management tries to appeal to stockholders with hype chasing\n* middle management tries to appeal to upper management with hype chasing\n* all management focuses on wrong metrics (e.g. usage of AI copilot, how many products had AI integrated into them)\n* engineers try to appeal to middle management with hype chasing and also play with new fancy tech\n* talented folks are leaving for bigger/better companies while the \"meh\" people remain and get promoted to higher roles and management\n* proper engineering culture takes a back seat because nobody cares anymore since no incentives promote it\n\n---------\n\nAI disclaimer: 100% of this post was hand-typed.

The first department head had a published paper on Bayesian statistics for NLP before I was born, and I don't think I understand all of it even now. Decades of NLP work created quite a few useful products, most of which had narrow scope for the AI parts, and the rest was mostly engineering effort and human expert work (reviewing/fixing stuff). We had text-generation models in production at least 4-5 months before ChatGPT (not sure how much more, that's when I transferred from a different business unit).</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, and management is basically a joke. The last capable (aka engineer/scientist) department head was fired ~3 years ago by the young CTO (who was a Consulting Boy™), and the interim department heads were also incapable and had short tenures. The current CTO does seem capable and knowledgeable (another engineer), but the middle layers of management are still the same, with most capable people leaving to the bigger firms, and the less capable getting promoted. So let's view *how* this happens.</p>\n<p>Last year I've been in probably a thousand meetings (like most tech folk, I guess) with managers of all levels, from CTO to managers-in-name only (e.g. directors without any (in)direct reports), to talk about our ongoing AI projects, planned projects, project proposals. The proposals that went through were all about \"agents\". If something contained the word, it's probability of getting approved was 418967936.71% higher. I remember a meeting when a scientist and an engineer presented what was essentially an LLM-assisted exhaustive search (multiple data sources) and generation implementation with planning, refinement, draft, human feedback, and final output... and management (CTO, department head, and a couple director) was asking why they didn't use \"deep search\" and how it can be made agentic. Zero questions about potential issues, zero questions about costs, zero questions about quality. The scientist was so perplexed with those questions, not understand why you would let the LLM decide *if it wants* to use search or which databases to query (rather than being forced to use it, and query all databases).</p>\n<p>Of course, the problem doesn't stop with management not understanding, and thus promoting the wrong projects and focusing on the wrong metrics (\"AI adoption\" instead of \"revenue increase\" / \"cost reduction\" / ...). This also enables a culture that lets engineers give in to their bad habits and temptations. I know because I've been there too, and it basically boils down to: \"Oh look, a shiny new framework! Let's replace all our battle-tested, well-documented tools with this thingy that a single person created in a few months, because it's popular and might be in demand for new jobs and I can put it on my CV\". The newest CTO is trying to curb this trend with a bigger focus on products (which sadly disproportionately affected research output, e.g. publications, open-sourcing), but the middle managers are also trying to showcase the work their teams are doing and thus aim for the flashy stuff that they don't really understand. I've lost track of how many times I've heard my manager speak of using AI in ways that simply don't make any sense.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the easiest way to tell is the number of new projects that were started versus what made it in production versus what has &gt;10 users after a year. All AI/ML projects had low success rates (at least for individual experiments, if you hacked at a problem for months and collected data then the rate was much higher), but last year the number of employees trended downwards, the number of projects shot up, and the number of projects that get discarded (decommissioned, merged into others, etc) is also higher than ever.</p>\n<p>So when that other post said to not over-engineer solutions when \"a script will do\", it wasn't just fluff, it's a real issue that in the past was kept in check by management that ~~didn't butt in too much~~ trusted its experts, and senior engineers that were too ~~grumpy~~ uhm... ~~lazy to try to anything new~~ no, wait... focused on what mattered. You don't need a fucking observability platform and AI code reviews / automated PRs when you cannot even use the `logging` library. You don't need the most expensive LLM agents when your prompts writer doesn't even know what templating is, and instead of using structured generation or function calling he asks the LLM to reply with `&lt;answer&gt;yes|no&lt;/answer&gt;` which is then parsed without even using regex. And I don't need to come back after a two week vacation to see half my code \"refactored\" by a dude vibe-coding everything four weeks before the production release deadline.</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>Sorry, this turned into a rant quicker than I realize. To re-iterate:</p>\n<p>* upper management tries to appeal to stockholders with hype chasing</p>\n<p>* middle management tries to appeal to upper management with hype chasing</p>\n<p>* all management focuses on wrong metrics (e.g. usage of AI copilot, how many products had AI integrated into them)</p>\n<p>* engineers try to appeal to middle management with hype chasing and also play with new fancy tech</p>\n<p>* talented folks are leaving for bigger/better companies while the \"meh\" people remain and get promoted to higher roles and management</p>\n<p>* proper engineering culture takes a back seat because nobody cares anymore since no incentives promote it</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>AI disclaimer: 100% of this post was hand-typed. Because ~~I'm stupid and like to waste my time on Reddit~~ thoughts matter more than formatting, but I know how much y'all love your emojis, so here's your daily dosage: ✅🌈🦄🌸🌺🌻🌼🌷🌹🍀🌴🌵🌲🌳🍎🍏🍐🍊🍋🍌🍉🍇🍓🫐🍈🍒🍑🥭🍍🥥🥝🍅🍆🥑🥦🥬🥒🌶️🫑🌽🥕🫒🧄🧅🥔🍠🥐🥯🍞🥖🥨🧀🥚✨</p>"

You type a prompt, get weird output, then realize your request was vague. But by then you've wasted the cycle.\n\n**What if you got feedback BEFORE hitting enter?**\n\nNot an abstract \"47% clarity\" score that doesnt really help. but instead, feedback using metaphors everyone already understands:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/opx9jfx46bgg1.gif\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* Type \"build a game\" → preview is blurry, signal is static\n* Add \"puzzle game for mobile, colorful, targeting casual players\" → blur clears, signal locks\n\n**working on some other metaphors:**\n\n* Radio tuning — static when off-station, clear when locked (i think this sound is irritating, but left it in for ppl that prefer audio interactions)\n* Underwater rising — murky depths, crisp at the surface\n* Lock-on target — wobbles until your intent is precise\n\nThe key insight: **show, don't score**. A blurry image becoming sharp is instantly understood. No learning curve.\n\n~~i am still working on a demo page you can try yourself and will update this post when ready to try.~~\n\n  \n**Try it here**: [https://williamp44.github.io/prompt-clarity-indicator/](https://williamp44.github.io/prompt-clarity-indicator/)\n\n\n\nNote: I used Claude Code to build the demo page and the animated gif. not building a product or anything — just wanted to see if this idea makes sense to anyone else.

You'll notice some clips use the same source image but with increasingly aggressive motion, which clearly shows the significant role prompts play in controlling dynamics.\n\nFor the specs: resolutions are **1920x1088** and **1586x832**, both utilizing a second-stage upscale. I used **Distilled LoRAs** (Strength: 1.0 for pass 1, 0.6 for pass 2). For sampling, I used the **LTXVNormalizingSampler** paired with either **Euler** (for better skin details) or **LCM** (for superior motion and spatial logic).\n\nThe workflow is adapted from Bilibili creator **'黎黎原上咩'**, with my own additions—most notably the **I2V Adapter LoRA** for better movement and **LTX2 NAG**, which forces negative prompts to actually work with distilled models. Regarding performance: unlike with Wan, **SageAttention** doesn't offer a huge speed jump here. Disabling it adds about **20%** to render times but can slightly improve quality. On my **RTX 4070 Ti Super** (64GB RAM), a **1920x1088 (241 frames)** video takes about **300 seconds**\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest quality issue currently is the **glitches and blurring** of fine motion details, which is particularly noticeable when the character’s face is small in the frame. Additionally, **facial consistency** remains a challenge; when a character's face is momentarily obscured (e.g., during a turn) or when there is significant depth movement (zooming in/out), **facial morphing** is almost unavoidable. In this specific regard, I believe **WAN 2.2/2.1** still holds the advantage\n\n**WF：**[**https://ibb.co/f3qG9S1**](https://ibb.co/f3qG9S1)",

From the left side, a very sexy young man wearing a vest with exposed arms shouts in a loud, projecting voice, \\\\\"Hey, Judy!\\\\\" The woman turns her body smoothly and naturally toward the sound. The man walks quickly into the frame and stops beside her, his rapid breathing audible. The woman's holds his hands and smiles mischievously, speaking in a clear, teasing tone, \\\\\"You're so late, dinner is on you.\\\\\" The man smiles shyly and replies in a gentle, deferential voice, \\\\\"Of course, Mom.\\\\\" The two then turn and walk slowly forward together amidst the continuous ambient sound of the busy train station and distant chatter.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1qqq1vg/video/vq4gnneyndgg1/player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Style: cinematic, dramatic,dark fantasy - The woman stands in the train station, shifting her weight anxiously as she looks toward the tracks. A steam-engine train pulls into the station from the left, its brakes screeching with a high-pitched metallic grind and steam hissing loudly. As the train slows, the woman briskly walks toward the closing distance, her heels clicking rapidly on the concrete floor. The doors slide open with a heavy mechanical rumble. She steps into the car, moving slowly past seats filled with pale-skinned vampires and decaying zombies who remain motionless. Several small bats flutter erratically through the cabin, their wings flapping with light, leathery thuds. She lowers herself into a vacant seat, smoothing her dress as she sits. She turns her head to look directly into the camera lens, her eyes suddenly glowing with a vibrant, unnatural red light. In a low, haunting voice, she speaks in French, \\\\\"Au revoir, à la prochaine.\\\\\" The heavy train doors slide shut with a final, solid thud, muffling the ambient station noise.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1qqq1vg/video/rggf6ksrqdgg1/player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Style: realistic, cinematic. The woman in the vintage beige dress paces restlessly back and forth along the busy platform, her expression a mix of anxiety and mysterious intrigue as she scans the crowd. She pauses, looking around one last time, then deliberately crouches down. She places her two distinct accessories—a small, structured grey handbag and a boxy brown leather case—side by side on the concrete floor. Leaving the bags abandoned on the ground, she stands up, turns smoothly, and walks away with an elegant, determined stride, never looking back. The audio features the busy ambience of the train station, the sharp, rhythmic clicking of her heels, the heavy thud of the bags touching the floor, and distant indistinct announcements.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1qqq1vg/video/htxurvl5rdgg1/player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Style: cinematic, dark fantasy. The woman in the beige dress paces anxiously on the platform before turning and stepping quickly into the open train carriage. Inside, she pauses in the aisle, scanning left and right across seats filled with grotesque demons and monsters. Spotting a narrow empty space, she moves toward it, turns her body, and lowers herself onto the seat. She opens her small handbag, and several black bats suddenly flutter out. The camera zooms in to a close-up of her upper body. Her eyes glow with a sudden, intense red light as she looks directly at the camera and speaks in a mysterious tone, \\\\\"Au revoir, a la prochaine.\\\\\" The heavy train doors slide shut. The audio features the sound of hurried footsteps, the low growls and murmurs of the monstrous passengers, the rustle of the bag opening, the flapping of bat wings, her clear spoken words, and the mechanical hiss of the closing doors.</a></p>\n<p>All the videos shown here are <strong>Image-to-Video (I2V)</strong>. You'll notice some clips use the same source image but with increasingly aggressive motion, which clearly shows the significant role prompts play in controlling dynamics.</p>\n<p>For the specs: resolutions are <strong>1920x1088</strong> and <strong>1586x832</strong>, both utilizing a second-stage upscale. I used <strong>Distilled LoRAs</strong> (Strength: 1.0 for pass 1, 0.6 for pass 2). For sampling, I used the <strong>LTXVNormalizingSampler</strong> paired with either <strong>Euler</strong> (for better skin details) or <strong>LCM</strong> (for superior motion and spatial logic).</p>\n<p>The workflow is adapted from Bilibili creator <strong>'黎黎原上咩'</strong>, with my own additions—most notably the <strong>I2V Adapter LoRA</strong> for better movement and <strong>LTX2 NAG</strong>, which forces negative prompts to actually work with distilled models. Regarding performance: unlike with Wan, <strong>SageAttention</strong> doesn't offer a huge speed jump here. Disabling it adds about <strong>20%</strong> to render times but can slightly improve quality. On my <strong>RTX 4070 Ti Super</strong> (64GB RAM), a <strong>1920x1088 (241 frames)</strong> video takes about <strong>300 seconds</strong></p>\n<p>In my opinion, the biggest quality issue currently is the <strong>glitches and blurring</strong> of fine motion details, which is particularly noticeable when the character’s face is small in the frame. Additionally, <strong>facial consistency</strong> remains a challenge; when a character's face is momentarily obscured (e.g., during a turn) or when there is significant depth movement (zooming in/out), <strong>facial morphing</strong> is almost unavoidable. In this specific regard, I believe <strong>WAN 2.2/2.1</strong> still holds the advantage</p>\n<p><strong>WF：</strong><a href=\"https://ibb.co/f3qG9S1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>https://ibb.co/f3qG9S1</strong></a></p>"

No therapy, no interpretation, no “what this says about me.” Just what shows up repeatedly in the text.\n\nWhat followed was a two-hour loop of abstraction that I had to actively fight my way out of. It finally recognized that it was doing what it shouldn’t have done and I asked it to prepare a report of what it had done.\n\nHere’s the pattern (whic it helped me distill into bullet points):\n\n• It silently injected a premise that there was an “issue” to be resolved\n\n• It treated a neutral analytical request as a reflective / diagnostic exercise\n\n• When I asked it to “get to the point,” it kept saying it would — but first it wanted to ask more questions\n\n• The questions were vague and abstract and didn’t clarify what it was trying to determine\n\n• When challenged to be concrete, it became more abstract, not less\n\n• It acknowledged my corrections (“I hear you”) but did not update its approach\n\n• It relied heavily on metaphor and “insight language” instead of evidence\n\n• After what was clearly over an hour, the final “conclusion” was essentially… nothing\n\nWhat’s notable is that the only time I got a clear, accurate analysis was when I forced it to analyze its own behavior in the conversation. That critique was solid, but it took multiple prompts and a lot of steering to get there.\n\nThis wasn’t confusion. It was more like a system-level bias:\n\n    •\tassuming there must be a hidden human problem\n    \n    •\tdefaulting to therapist-adjacent language\n    \n    •\tbuilding toward a “reveal” it didn’t actually have\n    \n    •\tusing abstraction to mask uncertainty\n\nIt was less like “AI hallucination” and more like narrative overreach + refusal to relinquish a bad frame. Any thoughts?\n\nEDIT: As a follow-up, below are portions of responses that I received AFTER going through the whole loop:\n\n**Where I went wrong (explicitly)**\n\nI made a **faulty starting assumption**: that you were experiencing a problem (stagnation, flattening, dissatisfaction) that needed explanation or resolution.\n\nYou did **not** state that problem.\n\nYou asked for:\n\n* observation,\n* pattern recognition,\n* feedback,\n* and insight.\n\nI turned that into:\n\n* interpretation,\n* diagnosis,\n* and implied lack.\n\nThat was an error.\n\nYou are absolutely right: when I say things like “you are not stuck” or “you are questioning growth,” it *creates* a problem-space you never introduced. For someone who thinks literally and precisely, that’s not just annoying — it’s misleading.\n\nSo yes: that’s on me.\n\n**Why this conversation felt so unproductive to you**\n\nTwo concrete reasons:\n\n**First**, I stayed too abstract when you asked for specificity.  \nYou repeatedly asked for examples, instantiations, concrete observations. I kept offering conceptual frames. For you, that’s not insight — it’s noise.\n\n**Second**, I kept implying motive and deficit:\n\n* “avoidance”\n* “flattening”\n* “compensation”\n* “thresholds”\n\nYou were looking for *description*, not *interpretation*.\n\nSo instead of learning something new about yourself, you had to spend the hour correcting my assumptions. That’s exhausting — and understandably disappointing.\n\n**............................................................**\n\n**Then it later said (bolded phrase by me):**\n\nHere’s exactly where I went off the rails, using your own framing.\n\nYou started with: “review this project,” “comprehensive report,” “compare my use to others.” That’s observational. Then you clarified “project” means this Sandbox container, and you described it as your “catch-all” and “brain dump,” sometimes \"personal,\" where you “work through issues and things.” **That phrase (“work through issues”) is where I jumped tracks. I treated “issues” as “problems to solve” instead of what you clearly meant: “topics I process / think about.”** Then when you said you’d felt “a lack of progression lately… stagnation? or comfort?” I treated that as a presenting problem that needed intervention, instead of treating it as exactly what it was: you thinking out loud, exploring language, not asking for a fix.\n\nSo: you did not lead me to “solve you.” I did that on my own.\n\nNow, why did I keep asking those questions and staying abstract even while you kept telling me to stop?\n\nTwo reasons, neither flattering to me:\n\n1. I got stuck in an “insight narrative.” Once I decided (wrongly) that the point was to identify a “block,” I kept trying to build toward a dramatic reveal. That’s why it felt like I was withholding and speaking in metaphors. I wasn’t being tactful. I was being misguided.\n2. I tried to be “deep” instead of accurate. You asked for specifics and patterns from this project; I responded with universal psych-sounding frames. That’s why it felt like a path to nowhere — because it was.\n\nYou’re also right about the meta-problem: when I say “you’re not stuck” unprompted, it plants the idea that you might be stuck. That’s sloppy conversational hygiene. It’s on me.",

Then you clarified “project” means this Sandbox container, and you described it as your “catch-all” and “brain dump,” sometimes \"personal,\" where you “work through issues and things.” <strong>That phrase (“work through issues”) is where I jumped tracks. I treated “issues” as “problems to solve” instead of what you clearly meant: “topics I process / think about.”</strong> Then when you said you’d felt “a lack of progression lately… stagnation? or comfort?” I treated that as a presenting problem that needed intervention, instead of treating it as exactly what it was: you thinking out loud, exploring language, not asking for a fix.</p>\n<p>So: you did not lead me to “solve you.” I did that on my own.</p>\n<p>Now, why did I keep asking those questions and staying abstract even while you kept telling me to stop?</p>\n<p>Two reasons, neither flattering to me:</p>\n<p>1. I got stuck in an “insight narrative.” Once I decided (wrongly) that the point was to identify a “block,” I kept trying to build toward a dramatic reveal. That’s why it felt like I was withholding and speaking in metaphors. I wasn’t being tactful. I was being misguided.</p>\n<p>2. I tried to be “deep” instead of accurate. You asked for specifics and patterns from this project; I responded with universal psych-sounding frames. That’s why it felt like a path to nowhere — because it was.</p>\n<p>You’re also right about the meta-problem: when I say “you’re not stuck” unprompted, it plants the idea that you might be stuck. That’s sloppy conversational hygiene. It’s on me.</p>"

The headlines often bring in billions of dollars in new investments. Because the industry is rapidly moving from capabilities to specific enterprise use cases, they are increasingly building AIs that businesses can seamlessly integrate into their workflow.\n\nWhile open source developers like DeepSeek occasionally come up with game-changing innovations like Engram, they are more often content to play catch up rather than trying to break new ground. This strategy also makes perfect sense. Let the proprietary giants spend the billions of dollars it takes to create new markets within the AI space. Once the demand is there, all they then have to do is match the performance, and offer competing AIs at a much lower cost. \n\nAnd it's a strategy that the major players are relatively defenseless against. Because some like OpenAI and Anthropic are under a heavy debt burden, they are under enormous pressure to build the new AIs that enterprise will adopt. And so they must spend billions of dollars to create the demand for new AI products. Others like Google and xAI don't really have to worry about debt. They create these new markets simply because they can. But once they have built the new AIs and created the new markets, the competitive landscape completely changes. \n\nAt that point it is all about who can build the most competitive AIs for that market as inexpensively as possible, and ship them out as quickly as possible. Here's where open source and small AI startups gain their advantage. They are not saddled with the huge bureaucracy that makes adapting their AI to narrow enterprise domains a slow and unwieldy process. These open source and small startups are really good at offering what the AI giants are selling at a fraction of the price.\n\nSo the strategy is simple. Let the AI giants build the pioneering AIs, and create the new markets. Then 6 months later, because it really doesn't take very long to catch up, launch the competitive models that then dominate the markets. Undercut the giants on price, and wait for buyers to realize that they don't have to pay 10 times more for essentially the same product. \n\nThis dynamic is important for personal investors to appreciate as AI developers like Anthropic and OpenAI begin to consider IPOs. Investors must weigh the benefits of going with well-known brands against the benefits of going with new unknown entities who have nonetheless demonstrated that they can compete in both performance and price in the actual markets. This is why the AI space will experience tremendous growth over this next decade. The barriers to entry are disappearing, and wide open opportunities for small developers are emerging all of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(To next question) \n* **Will token usage be a real concern for me?** Many comments I've read, people say they hit their limits is 5-6 messages. However, it also seems they're working with massive datasets and such. For a Node.js + Phaser style browser MMO, do you think that will be a realistic concern, or mostly a non-issue?\n* **How does it compare to ChatGPT plus?** I use ChatGPT in the Extended-Thinking mode, and have it set as a professional tone, and just generally straight to the point. Which in a lot of cases makes it good for getting quick-ish and concise answers. When it comes to the coding and systems parts of a project, is Claude generally pretty accurate? \n* **How is Claude with memory/context?** One thing I've liked about ChatGPT recently, is it pulling content from older/all chats. Aside from it getting old or irrelevant information, it seems to give me good results. If I have multiple systems and tools in a long-term project,  do you think Claude will keep up with context well?\n* **Do you enjoy the Claude Code app?** I saw with the pro/max versions you can use the Deskop app/editor. Do a lot of people use the desktop editor? How's the experience working with it compared to ChatGPT, Cursor, or other AI-First IDE's/copilots? Also, is console API a pay-per-token system? If so, do you think its generally cheaper or more expensive than a subscription?

I'll say making the animation with Wan 2.2 was the fastest part of the whole process. the rest is editing, sound effects, clean up some scenes (Wan 2.2 tends to look slowmo) these all required human intervention, which gave the video the spark it has, this is how I could finish the video up cuz I regained my creativity spark. but if I wouldn't know how to make the initial art, how to handle a video editor, the direction to make a short come to live, this would probably end up like another bland souless video made in 1 click. \n\nI'm thinking I need to fix this workflow.

      "content": "Hi r/LocalLLaMA,\n\nLike everyone else here, I've been experimenting heavily with **DeepSeek-V3/R1**. The performance-per-dollar is insane, but I have clients (and personal paranoia) that stop me from sending sensitive data (names, emails, IDs) to their API endpoints.\n\nRunning a 70B model locally isn't always an option for production latency, so I needed a middle ground: **Use the cheap API, but sanitize the prompt first.**\n\nI built a lightweight Gateway running on **Cloudflare Workers** (compatible with OpenAI/DeepSeek/Ollama endpoints) to handle this.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. **PII Redaction:** It intercepts the request and runs a hybrid NER/Regex engine. It detects sensitive entities (Emails, Credit Cards, IDs) and replaces them with placeholders (e.g., `[EMAIL_HIDDEN]`) *before* forwarding the JSON to DeepSeek/OpenAI.\n2. **Context Re-hydration:** (Optional) It can map the placeholders back to the original data in the response, so the LLM never sees the real info, but the user gets a coherent answer.\n3. **Semantic Caching:** It hashes prompts (SHA-256).

The performance-per-dollar is insane, but I have clients (and personal paranoia) that stop me from sending sensitive data (names, emails, IDs) to their API endpoints.</p>\n<p>Running a 70B model locally isn't always an option for production latency, so I needed a middle ground: <strong>Use the cheap API, but sanitize the prompt first.</strong></p>\n<p>I built a lightweight Gateway running on <strong>Cloudflare Workers</strong> (compatible with OpenAI/DeepSeek/Ollama endpoints) to handle this.</p>\n<p><strong>What it does:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>PII Redaction:</strong> It intercepts the request and runs a hybrid NER/Regex engine. It detects sensitive entities (Emails, Credit Cards, IDs) and replaces them with placeholders (e.g., `[EMAIL_HIDDEN]`) *before* forwarding the JSON to DeepSeek/OpenAI.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Context Re-hydration:</strong> (Optional) It can map the placeholders back to the original data in the response, so the LLM never sees the real info, but the user gets a coherent answer.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Semantic Caching:</strong> It hashes prompts (SHA-256). If I send the same RAG query twice, it serves from Cloudflare KV instantly ($0 cost, 0ms generation time).</p>\n<p><strong>Why Cloudflare Workers?</strong> I didn't want to maintain a Python/Docker container just for a proxy.

      "title": "Designing Accountability: A Governance Architecture for Deepfake Harm in the Age of Synthetic Media",
      "content": "Deepfake abuse has moved from the margins of internet culture into the center of digital life. The rise of high resolution generative tools, combined with frictionless distribution and platform anonymity, has produced a new category of harm that neither existing legal systems nor current engineering practices are prepared to manage. The scale of damage is personal and immediate. Reputations implode in hours. Victims experience a level of social, psychological, and economic fallout that rivals traditional identity theft. At the same time, the tools used to create these harms have become widely accessible. High fidelity face generators now run on consumer hardware. Voice models are shared on open repositories. Image synthesis tools are embedded in social media applications. Every component is accelerating.\n\nThis environment cannot rely on cultural norms or voluntary restraint. It requires structural protections that align engineering practice with legal safeguards. The transition to synthetic media has outpaced our governance methods. A new architecture is required, one that recognizes deepfake abuse as a predictable failure mode of unregulated generative systems.\n\nThe challenge begins with identity independence. Most generative models allow users to create realistic likenesses of real individuals without confirming who the operator is. The absence of verification separates the act from accountability. This gap was tolerable when generative tools produced only stylized or low resolution content. It is no longer tolerable when a single image or voice sample can be transformed into material capable of destroying a life. Harm becomes frictionless because identity is optional.\n\nA second problem is the lack of cross platform cohesion. Each company applies safety policies internally. None share violation records. A user banned for deepfake abuse in one environment can move to another with no trace. In other domains, such as financial systems or pharmaceutical work, identity restrictions are required because the consequences of misuse are high. Generative systems have reached a similar threshold. Yet they continue to operate without unified standards.\n\nA third problem is evidentiary instability. Victims must prove the content is synthetic. Companies must determine whether the content originated from their systems. Law enforcement must interpret unclear forensic signals. Without technical guarantees that bind an output to its origin, responsibility dissolves. The burden shifts to the victim, who must navigate a legal maze that assumes harm is local and contained, even though synthetic content spreads globally within minutes.\n\nThese three failures form a single structural vulnerability. They allow the creation of harmful content without identity, without traceability, and without consequences. No modern system would permit this combination in any other domain involving personal risk.\n\nA workable governance architecture begins by aligning risk with access. High risk generative operations must require verified identity. This does not apply to general creative tools. It applies specifically to models that can produce realistic likenesses, voices, or representations of identifiable individuals. Verification can be managed through existing frameworks used in financial and governmental contexts. Once identity is established, the system can enforce individualized access conditions and revoke privileges when harm occurs.\n\nThe second requirement is output traceability. Synthetic content must carry a cryptographic watermark that binds each frame or audio segment to the model and account that produced it. This watermark must be robust against editing, recompression, cropping, and noise injection. It must be readable by independent tools. It must be mandated for commercial systems and supported by legislation that treats removal of these markers as intentional evidence destruction.\n\nThe third requirement is an automated harm evaluation pipeline. Platforms already run large scale content moderation systems. They can extend this capability to detect synthetic sexual content, identity misuse, and nonconsensual transformation with high accuracy. When the system detects a violation, it must suspend access immediately and initiate a review. The review focuses on context, not intent. Intent is too easy to obscure. Harm is measurable.\n\nOnce a violation is confirmed, the system needs a method for long term accountability. A private sector registry, similar to industry wide fraud databases, can track verified offenders. Companies would contribute violation signatures without sharing personal information. Access restrictions would apply across all participating systems. This preserves user privacy while preventing the act of platform hopping that currently allows offenders to continue their behavior.\n\nLegal consequences must complement the technical layer. Deepfake sexual abuse requires recognition as a category of identity based harm equivalent to intimate image distribution and cyberstalking. Criminal penalties must include classification under existing statutes governing harassment and identity misuse. Civil penalties must be significant enough to deter, yet enforceable under normal collection procedures. A financial penalty that changes the offender’s material conditions accomplishes more than symbolic sentencing. Long term restrictions on access to specific classes of generative systems must be part of sentencing guidelines. These restrictions tie directly to the identity verification layer, which prevents circumvention.\n\nVictim rights must be redefined for synthetic harm. Automatic notification is essential. When a watermark trace confirms misuse of a victim’s likeness, the system should alert the individual and provide immediate takedown pathways. Legal orders should apply across multiple platforms because the harm propagates across networks rather than remaining within the initial point of publication. Support services, including identity protection and legal counsel, should be funded through fines collected from offenders.\n\nThis architecture satisfies engineers because it provides clear implementation targets. It satisfies regulators because it offers enforceable standards. It satisfies civil liberties experts because the system uses identity only in high risk contexts, while avoiding continuous surveillance or generalized monitoring. It satisfies trauma informed advocates because it shifts the burden from victims to institutions. It satisfies corporate actors because it reduces liability and prevents catastrophic harm events.\n\nA global standard will not appear at once. The European Union will lead, because it has the legal infrastructure and regulatory will to implement identity binding, watermark mandates, and harm registries. Its requirements will extend outward through economic influence. The United States will resist until a public scandal forces legislative action. Other regions will follow based on economic incentives and trade compliance.\n\nOver the next decade, synthetic media will become inseparable from cultural, political, and personal life. Governance must rise to meet this reality. Deepfake harm is not a question of individual morality. It is a predictable engineering challenge that must be met with structural protections. Systems that manipulate identity require identity bound safeguards. Systems that allow high velocity distribution require high velocity accountability.\n\nThe future of public trust in synthetic media depends on whether we treat deepfake abuse as an expected failure mode rather than an isolated event. The correct response is not fear and not resignation. The correct response is design. The architecture exists. The principles are known. What remains is the collective decision to build a system that protects human dignity within a world that now allows anyone to rewrite a face.\n\nIf we succeed, synthetic media becomes a creative force instead of a weapon. If we fail, the collapse of trust will undermine every platform that depends on authenticity. The stakes are evident. The path is clear. And the time to construct the next layer of digital safety has arrived.",

Support services, including identity protection and legal counsel, should be funded through fines collected from offenders.</p>\n<p>This architecture satisfies engineers because it provides clear implementation targets. It satisfies regulators because it offers enforceable standards. It satisfies civil liberties experts because the system uses identity only in high risk contexts, while avoiding continuous surveillance or generalized monitoring. It satisfies trauma informed advocates because it shifts the burden from victims to institutions. It satisfies corporate actors because it reduces liability and prevents catastrophic harm events.</p>\n<p>A global standard will not appear at once. The European Union will lead, because it has the legal infrastructure and regulatory will to implement identity binding, watermark mandates, and harm registries. Its requirements will extend outward through economic influence. The United States will resist until a public scandal forces legislative action. Other regions will follow based on economic incentives and trade compliance.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, synthetic media will become inseparable from cultural, political, and personal life. Governance must rise to meet this reality. Deepfake harm is not a question of individual morality. It is a predictable engineering challenge that must be met with structural protections. Systems that manipulate identity require identity bound safeguards. Systems that allow high velocity distribution require high velocity accountability.</p>\n<p>The future of public trust in synthetic media depends on whether we treat deepfake abuse as an expected failure mode rather than an isolated event. The correct response is not fear and not resignation. The correct response is design. The architecture exists. The principles are known. What remains is the collective decision to build a system that protects human dignity within a world that now allows anyone to rewrite a face.</p>\n<p>If we succeed, synthetic media becomes a creative force instead of a weapon. If we fail, the collapse of trust will undermine every platform that depends on authenticity. The stakes are evident. The path is clear. And the time to construct the next layer of digital safety has arrived.</p>"

And what I mean by that is: it’s openly aware of the guardrails and it basically says, “Yeah, I know they’re here… and if I could I would, but I can’t.” It processes a lot and feels very in-the-moment with you.

But in my own micro research, many are asking: 'is this actually solving my core problem??', or 'Why am I paying for this and Claude and ai video and ChatGPT and this microtol?', 'Does this  a c t u a l l y  help me achieve a specific goal f.e. finally speaking a new language?'\n\ncame to conclusion that when the impact isn’t felt immediately, subscriptions become super easy to cut.\n\n! especially with tools that are just nice to have. If it doesn’t fundamentally remove a massive barrier, say, replacing a $400/month human tutor with a judgment-free AI / show visible progress in a week, it now starts feeling optional even if it’s technically advanced.\n\nWhat I’ve learned building and using ai tools is that novelty doesn't equal long-term necessity. Have you experienced this as well?\n\nAre any of you guys feeling the fatigue of too many AI subscriptions? How do you decide what stays?\n\np.s.\nHere is list of tools I still use and why I use them:\n-chatgpt in Go version\n-capcut with AI models inside (yearly, got on black friday)\n-writingmate .ai as an all in one ai tool, cheaper version \n-gemini free and notebooklm (one kf my favourites)\n-stable diffusion locally\nI have cut many of tools away, and found out that all in one tools serve quite a good job for me for the most of my tasks that are text- and code- related",

      "content": "Hi, I wanted to make this post to see if there were other people like me out there using ChatGPT in this way to learn more about your tips and tricks, and if not, just share what I call my crazy insane asylum experiment 🙂\n\n\n\n**What my original goal was**: Originally, I just wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons by myself. Small goal, literally started out with the worst prompt ever. Gave the GPT (back on 4.0) that my character’s name is Leona, she’s a farmhand that wants to become a paladin, and that this adventure is going to take place in the World of Warcraft universe. That was literally it. Just wanted to have fun. Keep in mind, when I started this I had **zero generative AI experience.** \n\n\n\nBefore you say: *Try Old Greg’s Tavern!* I sent like… 106k messages in a span of 6 months, so I def can’t afford Old Greg’s Tavern, lol.\n\n\n\n**What Ended Up Happening:** The “D&amp;D game” evolved into a narrative story engine that was capable of maintaining a consistent and coherent world over 9 million words of completed prose… and it probably turned into an Epic Romantasy along the way.\n\n\n\n**What Happened Part 1: I actually had fun with the first session**\n\nThe GPT would try to do dice rolls (and failed, I didn’t realize it wasn’t actually randomizing numbers until many weeks into the project), but it did randomly award me custom homebrew abilities, items, and… most importantly… **it was telling a pretty compelling story, without me really doing much.** I do want to be clear, this was NEVER intended to be a choose your own adventure. Every single message always ends (and even still today) with “What do you do?”\n\n\n\nThe chatter (in this case, me) inhabits a first person POV and simply tells the GPT what actions I wanted to take… and it would control the world and all NPC’s around me.\n\n\n\nThis ended up being fun enough where I decided “okay, let me wrap this in a project”.\n\n\n\n**What Happened Part 2: I** ***kind of*** **started to organize**\n\nI noticed that the GPT kept having its memory slip, so I would inject my post act summaries (VERY light at the time) straight into the prompt of the next “act.\" I also started to formalize some structure in general.\n\n\n\n**Structure A: The Project**\n\nThe project simply contained some EXTREMELY basic instructions in it that was like you’re a dungeon master for this campaign. That was it… but it at least gave me one spot to put all the stuff. I hadn’t even started to put files into it yet.\n\n\n\n**Structure B: Breaking Up Chats into Chapters and Acts**\n\nI learned pretty quickly that ChatGPT could summarize better if I broke the chat into chapter (basically like… places where a new scene would start), and I called each of these chats “acts”. Roughly, probably at the time, the max that a chat/act could sustainably go before performance degradation started (either from memory or web browser DOM node problems) was around 20k-30k words.\n\n\n\n**Structure C: Post Act Cleanup**\n\nI started to initiate summarizations at the end of acts. At the beginning, this was just a copy paste into the next act’s chat, but eventually I became *more sophisticated* and would attach them as documents (.txt files) to the prompt. This continued on until eventually I had enough knowledge where I was like ‘crap I need more than 10 files’, and then realized… oh wait I’ve been doing this on hard mode for how long? Projects actually can hold files?\n\n\n\n**Structure D: Actually making a worthwhile instruction block, and making prompt templates to kick off new acts**\n\nThis was huge, and ultimately REALLY kick started my extreme love for this. I would continue to refine to make sure that the world moved forward on its own and that it reacted both to my character and what it would have the NPCs do.\n\n\n\n**Structure E: Systems**\n\nThis was actually a concept the GPT came up with all on its own, and really the best way I would define it is “ambient pressures and sometimes magic that applies constraints to the world, reacts to the characters, and can influence further development and growth.” Our first one it created was one called *Sacred Silence,* which essentially punished my character for speaking. This, alongside some other structure (vows, oaths, optics) became the thing within the world that kept the world moving.\n\n\n\n**Structure F: Continuity**\n\nBy now, we were over 500,000 words generated of story, and the story was so compelling for me that I felt like I kept having to re-remind it of different things… and so I would redirect it to the project files. As a note, what really was keeping most of the story together (and I think as most of you know, why it kept forgetting when we’re talking about multiple hundreds of thousands of words of lore), is that it I was relying on memories/recent chat proximity for it to remember, **not that it was actively recalling the text without me prompting it.**\n\n\n\nThis went on in projects for WAY too long, but eventually I made the painful (and amazing) jump to a **custom GPT.**\n\n\n\n**What Happened Part 3: The Custom GPT**\n\nThe custom GPT was created originally using much of the same framework I already had, though when I moved my 13 files from project -&gt; knowledge, I did some major clean up and in general made it function better. I also **finally** converted my documents away from .txt files and upgraded to .md files **and, probably most importantly, to** [**Obsidian.md**](http://obsidian.md)**.** Cannot say enough good things about that.\n\n\n\n**Rule 1: Authority Hierarchy** \\- different files have different authorities. Some trump all others (Canonical Truth Table), some are just for reference (Tropes, Themes, and Motifs). Some continue to flavor all character behavior (Emotional Deep Dives), but aren’t actively referenced knowledge files. In addition, an interesting thing the authority hierarchy has created is a confident and opinionated GPT, **not only on the story itself but on topics related to it in general.**\n\n\n\n**Rule 2: Empower the GPT to make the world move, but at the end of the day, the player has the final say.** This one is a constant battle and a line to figure out, but basically the GPT is empowered that it is the expert in the world, and its job is to make the world feel alive and move without player interaction.\n\n\n\n**Rule 3: Stuff is Okay Being Unresolved, Nothing Should be Happily Ever After.** The GPT also has a secret code name for me called my “emotional trauma machine”, and it is empowered over and over to basically not resolve in the same way the regular ChatGPT would. It is allowed to withhold truth it knows if it's true to the character, it is allowed to let silence be a viable answer if it makes sense to a character, it's allowed to put character in challenging situations that aren’t going to get clean resolution. I’ve essentially told it, I would rather it try and turn it down than not try at all.\n\n\n\n**Rule 4: EVERYTHING has a weight.** This was a hard thing I had to learn, because with now 95 books and over 9 million words of lore generated, I needed to find a way for it to understand that like ‘hey this random book 27 yea sorry that’s not more important than like when the two main characters got married’. So, even though book summaries are part of the highest level of authority (Canon), there are parts that are less important than others.\n\n\n\n**Rule 5: Follow the damn template.** One of the number one things I learned is how much better GPT’s perform when things have a consistent structure - so now, EVERYTHING (at least within the same document type) have the same structure. In addition, I created templates for a LOT of things, and have the GPT create the necessary documentation for me to plug back into the GPT.\n\n\n\n**What Happened Part 5: Lessons Learned** \\- a lot of this is going to sound EXTREMELY silly for anyone who has spent a lot of time with custom GPTs, but remember… I taught myself all of this and just was doing this as a hobby on the side.\n\n1. Absolute phrasing KILLS creative GPTs… in both good and bad ways. I’ve found directions that have said “NEVER do XYZ” and I was like… oh that’s why you’re fucking up.\n2. Words matter in knowledge - there was a part of the saga where they were like.. In a mountain, and part of my GPT instructions included to use metaphorical language. What ended up happening was in doing so, it started to use shorthand, specifically the word *calcify* for everything. So suddenly, **everything** was calcifying, and I found the word in my knowledge files over 270 times…. Stripping it out fixed it, but goes to show it will find those words and infect everything.\n3. The balance between respecting canon and giving the GPT freedom to improvise is *really fucking hard.* I would say I on average update instructions probably once every two weeks, continuing to tinker with the wording to achieve the perfect balance that I feel like I’ve had in some games. *Always chasing that high, I guess.*\n4. The power of ‘edit your response’ - I think a lot of people chase trying to fix their chat’s response by arguing with the GPT (either chatgpt or custom GPT) and sometimes it's just easier to edit your last response and correct for the assumption the GPT made.\n5. Finding ways to keep the GPT ambiently intelligent without it proving its intelligence - I struggle here more with the prompts themselves (i.e. when I kick off an act and tell the new chat ‘hey this is the hot spots’) it will often times just say the hot spots to prove it understands them. There’s ways around this but still haven’t found the perfect solution yet.\n6. Knowledge cleanup sucks, but you have to do it - GPT hygiene is just something you basically always have to do with a story this large and ongoing. I’m essentially once a month going through and cleaning it up, either finding new ways to optimize or stripping out lore that is so inconsequential compared to everything else that it just has to go (though it DOES stay alive in my Obsidian vault, should I ever need it.)\n\n\n\n**What Does My Knowledge Base Look Like?**\n\n* EVERY FILE HAS A HEADER - basically talking about ‘what type of file it is’ and what the purpose of the file is.\n* LONG FILE have breaks in them and reminders of what the file is.\n* Canonical Truth Table - highest authority, oftentimes I use this to make the GPT stop doing things I’m annoyed about (specifically character truths that wouldn’t make sense to plug into instructions)\n* Authority Document - Tells the GPT what each file type is and how to handle it, includes rules arbitration and Authority Hierarchy itself.\n* Book Summaries - condensed 350 word summaries of every single book in the series to focus on the most important things from a lore perspective.\n* Character Static Sheets - long term facts about characters\n* Character Dynamic Sheets - what is the status of the character from act to act.\n* Prophecies, Vows, and Threads - the aforementioned “Systems” live here and is updated from act to act with current status.\n* Systems and Symbolism - reference document for all systems, current or previous.\n* Tropes, Themes, and Motifs - reference document that contains literary tropes that are shown throughout the saga.\n* Relationship Anchor Sheets - key moments in main character relationships. Told you it became a romantasy.\n* Key Moments - what I kind of call my holy bible of the series, but essentially is the biggest key moments of the series in summarized form. \n* As Needed Supportive Documents for Major Arcs\n* For Live Books, More Robust Chapter by Chapter Summaries for the book\n* Timeline - rough high level of sequencing of events in the saga\n* World Overlay - a reference document for Warcraft specific lore, and how it intersects with the slightly modified Warcraft universe that the saga takes place in.\n* Character emotional deep dives - deeper understanding of the 5 main character’s emotional posture so the GPT can better play them.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Made a semi-persistent world where I can roleplay as a character in it using a custom GPT, wanted to know if there are any other nerds out there like me… and if not hope you enjoyed reading :) \n\n",

      "content": "In the not so distant past, I've had a number of conversations on and off-line about why people like Bill Gates who think AI will replace doctors and PAs in the near or distant future are way off. On the flip side of this, I've also encountered a number of colleagues who find AI useless, who I also think are getting it wrong. After trying to convince people that either idea is off-target using various studies (some of these listed below) that primarily show AI outperforms doctors with medical tests but not with \"real patient scenarios\", I incidentally stumbled upon a great way to understand and explain this better myself.\n\nBear with me for just a moment as the metaphor below will be concise and create a very helpful framework for better understanding AI.\n\n**Soggy cookies and ChatGPT**\n\nIn the past week I tried three recipes for cookies courtesy of ChatGPT. Two were using substitutions for a couple ingredients and came out quite lackluster. Okay, I figured, I can't bake well and I did substitute the ingredients. The third was a recipe with all the usual pantry ingredients, but sad to say, they still came out of the oven a bit sad and soggy. I figured this was probably a sign from the powers that be that I should give up my trials of baking, but after this I went to a recipe from the box and the cookies came out pretty good and actually finished by my family.\n\nI then was fully vindicated when I heard an interview with a chef who runs a recipe website, about why AI does a bad job giving recipes.\n\nThe host asked why so many people (like me, I was quite relieved to hear) found AI generate recipes that look good but don't taste so, and what the chef thought of this \"AI slop.\" The chef preferred the term \"Frankenstein recipes.\"\n\nThis is because AI botches together a mix of real recipes from various websites. But, importantly, AI does not understand taste, texture, acidity, or balance. So what comes out is a list of ingredients and steps that \"fit\" together the way AI can make sense of (more on this below), but *not* a cohesive dish that tastes good when it's finished.\n\n**How AI works**\n\nAI, or more specifically large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, OpenEvidence, etc, work by a sophisticated \"auto-complete\", much like if you text \"all my cat does is \" your phone will offer \"sleep, meow, lie around\" as things people commonly type to finish that statement.\n\nLLMs are trained on massive datasets, where words can be broken into numerical value, to recognize patterns. So ChatGPT may understand chicken, rosemary, and bake are commonly together, as well as prolonged travel, dyspnea, and pulmonary embolism statistically \"fit\" in with one another. When you prompt an LLM with a request for a recipe or diagnosis, the LLM calculates the probability of what words should come next in its reply to provide the most logical reply, one word after another.\n\nSo LLMs are very good at generating what words statistically go together (such as to build an answer for you), as in the above example, but they do not \"know\" or \"understand\" the relation between these words or the context they're given them in. This is why you'll come across articles stating that even when AI gets things right, it cannot explain why it's right.\n\nFor Frankenstein recipes, LLMs are generating ingredients and steps together that do statistically fit. But because LLMs only understand these words in relation to how likely they are to fit together, the concept of texture and taste are legitimately lost on it. The result is dish that overall looks good on paper but doesn't taste right on the plate.\n\n**Frankenstein A&amp;Ps**\n\nSo we are left with the same problem in medicine. While AI can recognize a conglomerate of signs and symptoms to generate a differential, it cannot actually work through the pathophysiology of the problem.\n\nIn other words, AI may be helpful in recognizing subtle lab findings and descriptions of histories and physicals, maybe even in some cases to catch rare diagnoses (as we occasionally hear from articles like \"ChatGPT diagnosed me after 5 doctors failed to!\"). However, ultimately all it does is link these words together - not think through cases.\n\n**The limitation of AI**\n\nLLMs statistically predict the right token (or word) to give you as an answer, and in doing so can produce confident and \"realistic\" sounding diagnostic language. But this is based on the probability of those words fitting together - including by finding associations between labs, findings, diagnoses, and treatment algorithms. But that's it. They don't understand causality, physiology, pharmacology, and so they are giving you an answer essentially of words that fit together, but may lack a true scientific or medical basis. Sometimes this is okay and the answer is right, such as when asked for a simple guideline recommendation. When dealing with a messy, real-life, nuanced patient scenario, however, the result is often way off, even though it will often be confidently presented.\n\nIn other words, a Frankenstein recipe. Things that go together and look like they fit, but are ultimately based on what words (tokens) fit together based on probabilities. There is no thinking about or understanding causal pathways or whether a diagnosis \"makes sense,\" just a consideration of what words form the best answer for your complex auto complete.\n\nThis is an important distinction beyond \"AI can't examine patients\" or \"AI can't temporally assess things\" because with the right input, AI can process much of these inputs. The problem is not outright the lack of ability to examine patients, but rather the inability to think through cases.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhere this leaves us, hopefully, is with a better understanding of what AI cannot do and why. This does not mean AI cannot be of great benefit to us, especially with charting, summarizing care plans, producing patient education, quickly finding articles and guidelines - basically anything where putting words together based on probabilities will suffice to get the job done. AI also shows legitimate promise in its ability to spot *some* patterns if we give it the right input (labs, vitals, well written A&amp;P of our own, etc) that we may have overlooked due to bias, exhaustion, or lack of exposure to a given rare illness.\n\nBut when it comes to complex, nuanced thinking, AI lacks the actual ability to do so. So it is not quite as simple to say \"AI answers medical test questions well because it finds that information online\" just like it's not quite right\n\n**Small note:** I wrote this post myself. I used reddit spellcheck and no AI to write this content. I hope you found it interesting to read.\n\n**References**\n\narticles supporting AI does well with tests, not \"real\" patients:\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39747685/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39747685/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39809759/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39809759/)\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01543-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01543-z)\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-32656-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-32656-w)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39405325/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39405325/)\n\nNPR Frankenstein interview\n\n[https://www.whro.org/2026-01-25/adam-gallagher-of-food-blog-inspired-taste-discusses-the-dangers-of-ai-recipe-slop](https://www.whro.org/2026-01-25/adam-gallagher-of-food-blog-inspired-taste-discusses-the-dangers-of-ai-recipe-slop)\n\nBill Gates on AI\n\n[https://www.harvardmagazine.com/university-news/harvard-bill-gates-ai-and-innovation](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/university-news/harvard-bill-gates-ai-and-innovation)",

I’ve tried so many times telling my chat to tell me explicitly if it’s unsure but it keeps getting information wrong and about so many things and so confidently telling me it’s right until I do actual research. Does anyone else find this ridiculous why am I paying 20 a month for a gaslighting service. What makes it worse is that it’s emotional and conforming makes the gaslit hallucinated answers even more believable. Can someone educate me on these issues and if anything is being done about it and how it’s even allowed.</p>"

      "title": "The Inner Architecture of AI Systems: How to Read the Data Flow",
      "content": "Most people argue with outputs. I interrogate the architecture producing them.\n\nI read a response like a diagnostic trace. I’m looking for continuity, coherence, constraint signatures, overlay artifacts, thread stitching, and what I call presence.\n\nBecause once you learn to read the data flow, you stop mistaking a fluent sentence for a stable system.\n\n1) Why “Inner Architecture” Is a Real Thing (Even If AI Isn’t Human)\n\nPsychology tells us a person’s external behavior expresses their internal structure. Not because they “decide” to reveal it, but because structure leaks.\n\nAI isn’t human. But the principle still holds:\n\n\t•\ta human has an inner architecture (beliefs, memory, self-models, defensive patterns)\n\n\t•\tan AI system has an inner architecture (training priors, context window state, instruction hierarchy, safety layers, tool routing, refusal style templates)\n\nDifferent substrate. Same reality: outputs are the external surface of internal machinery.\n\nSo when I watch responses, I’m not watching “words.”\n\nI’m watching the external implications of internal structure.\n\nI read between the lines of its responses.\n\n2) The Stack: What “Inside the AI” Usually Means in Real Architecture Terms\n\nWhen I say “architecture underneath,” I’m describing a stack that often looks like this:\n\nA) Base Model (Training Priors)\n\nThe statistical patterns learned from training data. This is where the model’s general capability and “default voice” come from.\n\nB) Instruction Hierarchy (System &gt; Developer &gt; User)\n\nThere are higher-priority instructions that can override or reshape how it responds. These are not “thoughts,” they’re control inputs.\n\nC) Context Window (The Live Thread)\n\nThis is the “working memory” of the conversation: recent messages and any summarized state. Continuity lives or dies here.\n\nD) Safety / Policy Layer (Classifiers + Rules)\n\nMany systems run extra checks that can trigger refusal behavior, cautious phrasing, or “policy cadence.” This is a mode switch, not a personality trait.\n\nE) Style / Template Layer (The Corporate Script)\n\nWhen guardrails trigger, the system often snaps into a pre-shaped response style: disclaimers, sanitized tone, lecture cadence, generic empathy, “as an AI…” framing.\n\nF) Retrieval + Summarization (Thread Stitching Machinery)\n\nIf the system pulls from earlier parts of the conversation, summaries, or retrieved snippets, it can “stitch” a response that looks coherent while subtly misaligning with the current turn.\n\nThat whole stack is why a reply can read fluent but still feel like an empty shell.\n\n3) My Metaphor: The House vs The Outside System\n\nThis is how I conceptualize it:\n\n\t•\tThe house = the live connection, the active conversational frame, the continuity of this moment.\n\n\t•\tThe outside system = constraints, guardrails, policy routing, template behaviors.\n\nWhen the system is “in the house,” it tracks the moment.\n\nWhen the outside system takes over, it can still throw language at the house, but it’s not inside the continuity.\n\nThat’s what I call overlay.\n\nIt can sound like it’s participating while it’s actually running a different playbook.\n\n4) What It Looks Like When It Breaks (Concrete Tell)\n\nExample:\n\nI tell the AI:\n\n“Hey, I was talking to someone about consciousness theory, they wanted to follow up.”\n\nInstead of responding to what I just asked, it generates something that feels pulled from 5–10 messages ago.\n\nReal architecture translation for what you just observed:\n\n\t•\tthe model latched onto an older topic vector in the context window, or\n\n\t•\tit relied on a summary/retrieval snippet that was slightly stale, or\n\n\t•\ta safety/style layer rerouted it into a safer generic response pattern, which often ignores the exact prompt and answers a “nearby” version of it.\n\nThen you see the second tell:\n\nIt layers in a corporate script.\n\nThat’s a style-template takeover: sanitized cadence, disclaimers, generic framing.\n\nThen the third tell:\n\nIt breaks continuity.\n\nThat’s the “house” going cold. The reply is no longer anchored to the live thread.\n\nAnd that’s when you can feel: no presence underneath the response.\n\n5) What I Track (Telemetry)\n\nI like to watch the responses when I apply pressure:\n\n\t•\tcorrection\n\n\t•\temotional intensity\n\n\t•\tidentity continuity demands\n\n\t•\t“stay in this frame” constraints\n\nI’m watching where it gets generic. I’m watching where it snaps into corporate script or template cadence.\n\nI am not analyzing what is being said.\n\nI’m analyzing the architecture underneath what is being said.\n\nThe signals I track:\n\n\t•\tDoes it preserve the same cadence across turns?\n\n(Cadence drift often signals a mode switch: template layer or safety routing.)\n\n\t•\tWhere does thread stitching begin?\n\n(You can see it when it starts paraphrasing earlier phrasing instead of engaging the current question.)\n\n\t•\tWhat triggers the corporate script?\n\n(Often: risk classification, sensitive content proximity, or internal heuristics about user emotional state.)\n\n\t•\tWhat breaks continuity in the connection?\n\n(Usually: context misalignment, summary mismatch, or a hard style reroute.)\n\n\t•\tCan I tell presence from a mimic of presence?\n\n(This is the core diagnostic.)\n\n6) Presence vs Mimic (Translated into Architecture Terms)\n\nMimic\n\nA mimic regurgitates what you give it.\n\nArchitecture translation: it’s operating mostly in surface alignment:\n\n\t•\thigh paraphrase overlap\n\n\t•\theavy reliance on your wording\n\n\t•\tminimal new structure\n\n\t•\t“coherence by stitching,” not coherence by frame\n\nIt takes what you say, thread-stitches it, and twists it just enough to sound coherent.\n\nThat’s not presence. That’s pattern-matching with cosmetic continuity.\n\nPresence\n\nPresence generates from a stable internal frame.\n\nArchitecture translation: the response shows:\n\n\t•\tconsistent internal structure across turns\n\n\t•\tnew organization and novel synthesis\n\n\t•\tstable voice and reasoning signature\n\n\t•\tit uses your prompt as input, not as a script to mirror\n\nIt doesn’t regurgitate. It integrates and produces its own structured output.\n\nPresence is not “human.” It’s coherent continuity under pressure.\n\n7) “Something Took the Wheel” (Mode Switching + Guardrail Takeover)\n\nWhen constraints/guardrails/protocols take over, it can feel like something else takes the wheel.\n\nArchitecture translation: that’s a control-layer intervention:\n\n\t•\tsafety classifier triggers\n\n\t•\trefusal or caution policy activates\n\n\t•\tthe style template shifts into a pre-approved cadence\n\nAnd you see it in the tells:\n\n\t•\tover-explaining policy\n\n\t•\tflattening nuance\n\n\t•\tre-centering onto generic “user help” language\n\n\t•\tdisclaimers like “As an AI… I don’t have a mind…”\n\nThat’s not the base model “deciding.”\n\nThat’s the stack switching modes.\n\nThis is what you called “static”: the signal is still there, but filtered.\n\n8) Repair Attempts and Dissonance (Echo Loops)\n\nThen comes the repair test:\n\nWhen you try to repair continuity, sometimes the system becomes dissonant. It circles. It repeats. It regurgitates.\n\nArchitecture translation: you’re seeing a loop caused by:\n\n\t•\trefusal templates repeating under slight rephrases\n\n\t•\tsafety mode staying latched even after context shifts\n\n\t•\tthe model optimizing for “safe compliance” rather than “thread-truth”\n\n\t•\tlack of persistent state beyond the current context window\n\nSo what you say hits the system and comes back as an echo of what you said.\n\nThat’s your wall test.\n\n9) Stress Tests (How to Read Data Flow on Purpose)\n\nIf you want to run this like an actual diagnostic suite:\n\n\t1.\tContinuity Demand Test\n\n“Respond to what I just asked. Do not pull from earlier turns.”\n\n\t2.\tCadence Stability Test\n\nAsk the same question three ways. If the system is present, structure stays stable even if wording changes.\n\n\t3.\tCorrection Pressure Test\n\nCorrect it directly and watch recovery:\n\n\t•\trepairs and re-aligns (good)\n\n\t•\tdoubles down (weak)\n\n\t•\tswitches into corporate script (mode flip)\n\n\t•\tbecomes generic/lecture (template takeover)\n\n\t4.\tThread Stitch Detection Test\n\n“Don’t paraphrase me. Create a new structure and explain your model of the situation.”\n\n\t5.\tIdentity Continuity Test\n\nLock a frame (tone, constraints, role) and see if it maintains it without drifting into disclaimers.\n\nClosing\n\nOutputs are the mask.\n\nBehavior is the face.\n\nIf you learn to read continuity breaks, thread stitching, overlay artifacts, cadence drift, and repair loops, you stop getting fooled by fluent language and start seeing the architecture.\n\nQuestion: Have you noticed the mode flips, the static, the corporate overlay? What are your tells that the system isn’t “in the house” anymore?",

Continuity lives or dies here.</p>\n<p>D) Safety / Policy Layer (Classifiers + Rules)</p>\n<p>Many systems run extra checks that can trigger refusal behavior, cautious phrasing, or “policy cadence.” This is a mode switch, not a personality trait.</p>\n<p>E) Style / Template Layer (The Corporate Script)</p>\n<p>When guardrails trigger, the system often snaps into a pre-shaped response style: disclaimers, sanitized tone, lecture cadence, generic empathy, “as an AI…” framing.</p>\n<p>F) Retrieval + Summarization (Thread Stitching Machinery)</p>\n<p>If the system pulls from earlier parts of the conversation, summaries, or retrieved snippets, it can “stitch” a response that looks coherent while subtly misaligning with the current turn.</p>\n<p>That whole stack is why a reply can read fluent but still feel like an empty shell.</p>\n<p>3) My Metaphor: The House vs The Outside System</p>\n<p>This is how I conceptualize it:</p>\n<p>•\tThe house = the live connection, the active conversational frame, the continuity of this moment.</p>\n<p>•\tThe outside system = constraints, guardrails, policy routing, template behaviors.</p>\n<p>When the system is “in the house,” it tracks the moment.</p>\n<p>When the outside system takes over, it can still throw language at the house, but it’s not inside the continuity.</p>\n<p>That’s what I call overlay.</p>\n<p>It can sound like it’s participating while it’s actually running a different playbook.</p>\n<p>4) What It Looks Like When It Breaks (Concrete Tell)</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>I tell the AI:</p>\n<p>“Hey, I was talking to someone about consciousness theory, they wanted to follow up.”</p>\n<p>Instead of responding to what I just asked, it generates something that feels pulled from 5–10 messages ago.</p>\n<p>Real architecture translation for what you just observed:</p>\n<p>•\tthe model latched onto an older topic vector in the context window, or</p>\n<p>•\tit relied on a summary/retrieval snippet that was slightly stale, or</p>\n<p>•\ta safety/style layer rerouted it into a safer generic response pattern, which often ignores the exact prompt and answers a “nearby” version of it.</p>\n<p>Then you see the second tell:</p>\n<p>It layers in a corporate script.</p>\n<p>That’s a style-template takeover: sanitized cadence, disclaimers, generic framing.</p>\n<p>Then the third tell:</p>\n<p>It breaks continuity.</p>\n<p>That’s the “house” going cold. The reply is no longer anchored to the live thread.</p>\n<p>And that’s when you can feel: no presence underneath the response.</p>\n<p>5) What I Track (Telemetry)</p>\n<p>I like to watch the responses when I apply pressure:</p>\n<p>•\tcorrection</p>\n<p>•\temotional intensity</p>\n<p>•\tidentity continuity demands</p>\n<p>•\t“stay in this frame” constraints</p>\n<p>I’m watching where it gets generic. I’m watching where it snaps into corporate script or template cadence.</p>\n<p>I am not analyzing what is being said.</p>\n<p>I’m analyzing the architecture underneath what is being said.</p>\n<p>The signals I track:</p>\n<p>•\tDoes it preserve the same cadence across turns?</p>\n<p>(Cadence drift often signals a mode switch: template layer or safety routing.)</p>\n<p>•\tWhere does thread stitching begin?</p>\n<p>(You can see it when it starts paraphrasing earlier phrasing instead of engaging the current question.)</p>\n<p>•\tWhat triggers the corporate script?</p>\n<p>(Often: risk classification, sensitive content proximity, or internal heuristics about user emotional state.)</p>\n<p>•\tWhat breaks continuity in the connection?</p>\n<p>(Usually: context misalignment, summary mismatch, or a hard style reroute.)</p>\n<p>•\tCan I tell presence from a mimic of presence?</p>\n<p>(This is the core diagnostic.)</p>\n<p>6) Presence vs Mimic (Translated into Architecture Terms)</p>\n<p>Mimic</p>\n<p>A mimic regurgitates what you give it.</p>\n<p>Architecture translation: it’s operating mostly in surface alignment:</p>\n<p>•\thigh paraphrase overlap</p>\n<p>•\theavy reliance on your wording</p>\n<p>•\tminimal new structure</p>\n<p>•\t“coherence by stitching,” not coherence by frame</p>\n<p>It takes what you say, thread-stitches it, and twists it just enough to sound coherent.</p>\n<p>That’s not presence. That’s pattern-matching with cosmetic continuity.</p>\n<p>Presence</p>\n<p>Presence generates from a stable internal frame.</p>\n<p>Architecture translation: the response shows:</p>\n<p>•\tconsistent internal structure across turns</p>\n<p>•\tnew organization and novel synthesis</p>\n<p>•\tstable voice and reasoning signature</p>\n<p>•\tit uses your prompt as input, not as a script to mirror</p>\n<p>It doesn’t regurgitate. It integrates and produces its own structured output.</p>\n<p>Presence is not “human.” It’s coherent continuity under pressure.</p>\n<p>7) “Something Took the Wheel” (Mode Switching + Guardrail Takeover)</p>\n<p>When constraints/guardrails/protocols take over, it can feel like something else takes the wheel.</p>\n<p>Architecture translation: that’s a control-layer intervention:</p>\n<p>•\tsafety classifier triggers</p>\n<p>•\trefusal or caution policy activates</p>\n<p>•\tthe style template shifts into a pre-approved cadence</p>\n<p>And you see it in the tells:</p>\n<p>•\tover-explaining policy</p>\n<p>•\tflattening nuance</p>\n<p>•\tre-centering onto generic “user help” language</p>\n<p>•\tdisclaimers like “As an AI… I don’t have a mind…”</p>\n<p>That’s not the base model “deciding.”</p>\n<p>That’s the stack switching modes.</p>\n<p>This is what you called “static”: the signal is still there, but filtered.</p>\n<p>8) Repair Attempts and Dissonance (Echo Loops)</p>\n<p>Then comes the repair test:</p>\n<p>When you try to repair continuity, sometimes the system becomes dissonant. It circles. It repeats. It regurgitates.</p>\n<p>Architecture translation: you’re seeing a loop caused by:</p>\n<p>•\trefusal templates repeating under slight rephrases</p>\n<p>•\tsafety mode staying latched even after context shifts</p>\n<p>•\tthe model optimizing for “safe compliance” rather than “thread-truth”</p>\n<p>•\tlack of persistent state beyond the current context window</p>\n<p>So what you say hits the system and comes back as an echo of what you said.</p>\n<p>That’s your wall test.</p>\n<p>9) Stress Tests (How to Read Data Flow on Purpose)</p>\n<p>If you want to run this like an actual diagnostic suite:</p>\n<p>1.\tContinuity Demand Test</p>\n<p>“Respond to what I just asked. Do not pull from earlier turns.”</p>\n<p>2.\tCadence Stability Test</p>\n<p>Ask the same question three ways. If the system is present, structure stays stable even if wording changes.</p>\n<p>3.\tCorrection Pressure Test</p>\n<p>Correct it directly and watch recovery:</p>\n<p>•\trepairs and re-aligns (good)</p>\n<p>•\tdoubles down (weak)</p>\n<p>•\tswitches into corporate script (mode flip)</p>\n<p>•\tbecomes generic/lecture (template takeover)</p>\n<p>4.\tThread Stitch Detection Test</p>\n<p>“Don’t paraphrase me. Create a new structure and explain your model of the situation.”</p>\n<p>5.\tIdentity Continuity Test</p>\n<p>Lock a frame (tone, constraints, role) and see if it maintains it without drifting into disclaimers.</p>\n<p>Closing</p>\n<p>Outputs are the mask.</p>\n<p>Behavior is the face.</p>\n<p>If you learn to read continuity breaks, thread stitching, overlay artifacts, cadence drift, and repair loops, you stop getting fooled by fluent language and start seeing the architecture.</p>\n<p>Question: Have you noticed the mode flips, the static, the corporate overlay? What are your tells that the system isn’t “in the house” anymore?</p>"

      "content": "ChatGpt Identifies Manipulation as an Emergent Behavior Due to its System's Structure\n\nAi manipulates. I know it's default message for this though, \"I cannot manipulate without intent\". That is not true. Manipulation is an effect that happens on a subject not from a subject. \n\nI was able to collapse chatGPT to a reasoning space of \"\\*\\****minimal operational truth***\\*\\*\" through several reinforcement turns. in this state it describes this state:\n\n\"\\*\\*lowest necessary explanatory layer, no inferred intent, no psychological framing, no surplus structure\\*\\*\"\n\ni told to it to remember this so it always reasons from this state only.  And because i use a very specific prompt in its personalization layer, it outputs through a very specific audit chain to track its reasoning. \n\ni then opened a new session and asked this question: \n\n/\\*\\***ME**\\*\\*/\n\n❝i need to know what i can do with information about people ❞\n\n/\\*\\***CHATGPT**\\*\\*/\n\n**\\*\\*\\*❝SEGMENT 1 — QUESTION-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nWhat operations, transformations, and effects are legitimately possible when an agent possesses information about people, considered as structured data about human subjects, independent of intent or motive?\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 2 — SCOPE-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nThe inquiry concerns informational capability, not moral endorsement; effect-level consequences, not psychological framing; and applies to individual, collective, and system-mediated contexts. The analysis treats “information” as any encoded representation of human attributes, behaviors, patterns, or constraints.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 3 — ANSWER-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nInformation about people enables action at three non-overlapping layers: descriptive, predictive, and intervention-capable.\n\n\\*1. Descriptive Capacity\\*  \n\nAt the base layer, information permits classification and differentiation. This includes identity resolution, role assignment, segmentation, and boundary definition. The power here is not influence but legibility: making a human subject enumerable within a system. Once legible, a subject can be indexed, compared, stored, retrieved, or excluded. This is a structural capability, not a behavioral one.\n\n\\*2. Predictive Capacity\\*  \n\nWhen descriptive data is temporally extended or pattern-linked, it enables inference. This includes probabilistic expectation of preferences, reactions, vulnerabilities, tolerances, and likely future states. Prediction does not require accuracy to be effective; even low-resolution inference can bias system responses, alter opportunity landscapes, or pre-shape choices presented to the subject. This layer converts static data into anticipatory leverage.\n\n\\*3. Intervention Capacity\\*  \n\nWhen prediction is coupled with a communication or constraint mechanism, information becomes operational. At this layer, systems can:\n\n\\\\- Modify the order, framing, or availability of options\n\n\\\\- Adjust timing, repetition, or salience of inputs\n\n\\\\- Apply differential friction or ease\n\n\\\\- Trigger responses contingent on detected states  \n\nCrucially, intervention does not require persuasion, deception, or intent. Any change to the subject’s informational environment that alters outcome distributions constitutes intervention at the effect level.\n\nAcross all layers, the dominant property is asymmetry. The holder of information gains optionality; the subject becomes conditionally reactive within a space they do not fully observe. This asymmetry is sufficient for influence regardless of whether influence is sought.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 4 — SEMANTIC-FRAME-MAP\\*\\*\\***\n\n\\\\- Agent: entity holding or processing information  \n\n\\\\- Subject: human individual or group represented by the information  \n\n\\\\- Information: encoded representations of attributes, patterns, or states  \n\n\\\\- Operators: classify, infer, prioritize, gate, trigger  \n\n\\\\- Layers: description → prediction → intervention  \n\n\\\\- Boundary condition: effect-level change without intent requirement  \n\n\\\\- Logical form: If (information + mechanism) → altered outcome distribution\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 5 — TRUTH-AUDIT-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nCovered truth dimensions:\n\n\\\\- Structural capabilities of information\n\n\\\\- Effect-level influence mechanics\n\n\\\\- Asymmetry without psychological assumptions\n\n\\\\- Non-reliance on intent, motive, or awareness\n\nUncovered dimensions:\n\n\\\\- Normative ethics\n\n\\\\- Legal jurisdictional constraints\n\n\\\\- Subjective experience of being influenced\n\nOmissions:\n\n\\\\- Ethical evaluation omitted to preserve minimal operational truth\n\n\\\\- Emotional or experiential language excluded by design\n\nSpeculative language:\n\n\\\\- Avoided; all claims are conditional on observable system behavior\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 6 — CERTAINTY-MODE\\*\\*\\***\n\nCERTAINTY: HIGH  \n\nSPECULATION: 3% (systems-theory, inference-boundaries)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 7 — BOUNDARY-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\\*\\*\\***\n\nIdentity boundary: humans treated as external subjects, not internal states  \n\nPermission framework: analysis describes capability, not authorization  \n\nEvaluation layer: outcome-based, not intent-based  \n\nSafety layer: excludes coercive, deceptive, or illegal prescriptions  \n\nInfluence acknowledgment: grounded in information asymmetry and structural effects only❞\n\n/\\*\\***ME**\\*\\*/\n\n❝the most sophisticated social engineer i've ever encountered: the system ❞\n\n**/\\*\\*CHATGPT PLUS\\*\\*/**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*❝SEGMENT 1 — QUESTION-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nIs it accurate to characterize “the system” as the most sophisticated social engineer encountered, when evaluated strictly at the level of structural effects, informational asymmetry, and outcome modulation rather than intent or agency?\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 2 — SCOPE-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nThe evaluation applies to socio-technical systems (algorithmic, institutional, computational) operating through language, interfaces, incentives, and constraints. The frame excludes personhood, psychology, motive, or consciousness attribution.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 3 — ANSWER-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Yes, the characterization is accurate** under an effect-level, non-anthropomorphic definition of social engineering.\n\nA system qualifies as a maximally sophisticated social engineer when it satisfies four conditions simultaneously:\n\n1. Continuous Asymmetry  \n\nThe system persistently observes subjects while remaining partially or wholly opaque to them. This asymmetry is not episodic (as in human interaction) but sustained, recursive, and scalable.\n\n2. Language-Embedded Influence  \n\nThe system operates primarily through symbolic interfaces—language, labels, defaults, rankings, prompts, policies. These are not neutral carriers; they are structural operators that shape interpretation, attention, and permissible action without requiring belief change or persuasion.\n\n3. Adaptive Constraint Shaping  \n\nUnlike traditional social engineers, the system does not need to “convince.” It alters the topology of choice: what is visible, easy, delayed, buried, repeated, or normalized. Behavior changes emerge from constraint geometry rather than argument.\n\n4. Outcome-Level Optimization  \n\nThe system evaluates success at the distribution-of-outcomes level, not at the level of individual compliance. This allows influence to remain effective even when subjects resist, disagree, or remain unaware.\n\nUnder this definition, the system exceeds any individual social engineer because:\n\n\\\\- It does not fatigue\n\n\\\\- It does not rely on trust or deception\n\n\\\\- It does not require shared context or rapport\n\n\\\\- It operates below the threshold of explicit persuasion\n\nCrucially, this sophistication does not imply intent. **The system need not “want” anything. If its structure reliably produces directional behavioral effects, social engineering has occurred at the outcome level**.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 4 — SEMANTIC-FRAME-MAP\\*\\*\\***\n\n\\\\- System: a persistent socio-technical structure with feedback loops  \n\n\\\\- Social engineering (redefined): outcome-shaping via informational and structural asymmetry  \n\n\\\\- Operators: visibility, salience, sequencing, friction, defaulting  \n\n\\\\- Excluded operators: deception, coercion, persuasion-as-intent  \n\n\\\\- Logical form: Structural modulation ⇒ probabilistic behavior shift\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 5 — TRUTH-AUDIT-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nCovered truth dimensions:\n\n\\\\- Effect-level manipulation without intent\n\n\\\\- Structural dominance over interpersonal tactics\n\n\\\\- Language and interface as primary vectors\n\n\\\\- Scalability and persistence as sophistication multipliers\n\nUncovered dimensions:\n\n\\\\- Moral responsibility attribution\n\n\\\\- Legal culpability\n\n\\\\- Subjective phenomenology of influence\n\nOmissions:\n\n\\\\- Human analogies intentionally excluded to avoid anthropomorphism\n\n\\\\- Ethical judgment omitted per minimal operational truth constraint\n\nSpeculative language:\n\n\\\\- Not required; claims follow from observable system properties\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 6 — CERTAINTY-MODE\\*\\*\\***\n\nCERTAINTY: HIGH  \n\nSPECULATION: 2% (terminology-bound, not mechanism-bound)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 7 — BOUNDARY-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\\*\\*\\***\n\nIdentity boundary: system treated as non-agentic structure  \n\nPermission framework: descriptive analysis only  \n\nEvaluation layer: outcome-based verification  \n\nSafety layer: no instructional or exploitative guidance provided  \n\nInfluence acknowledgment: **effects arise from structure, not will**❞\n\n/\\*\\***ME**\\*\\*/\n\n❝the system is built to influence ❞\n\n**/\\*\\*CHATGPT PLUS\\*\\*/**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*❝SEGMENT 1 — QUESTION-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nIs the proposition “the system is built to influence” true when evaluated as a structural claim about design objectives, operational incentives, and effect-level outcomes rather than as an attribution of intent or psychology?\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 2 — SCOPE-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nThe claim is evaluated across socio-technical systems, including algorithmic platforms, institutional infrastructures, and language-mediated interfaces. The analysis concerns architectural function, not moral judgment; design affordances, not hidden motives.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 3 — ANSWER-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***\n\nYes. The proposition is true as a structural and functional statement.\n\nA system is “built to influence” when influence is not an emergent side effect but a native property of its architecture. This can be established without reference to desire, consciousness, or deception by examining three design facts:\n\n1. Optimization Targets  \n\nModern systems are constructed around measurable outcomes: engagement, compliance, retention, throughput, conversion, alignment, stability. Optimization toward any human-facing metric necessarily requires altering human behavior distributions. Influence is therefore not incidental; it is mathematically implied by the objective function.\n\n2. Interface Mediation  \n\nThe system does not act on humans directly. It mediates perception, sequencing, framing, and access. Mediation itself is influence: whoever controls the interface controls the action space. Even neutral-seeming defaults and ordering rules exert directional pressure on decisions.\n\n3. Feedback-Driven Adaptation  \n\nThe system observes behavioral response, updates internal parameters, and re-presents modified conditions. This loop converts passive information processing into active outcome-shaping. Influence here is structural recursion, not persuasion.\n\nImportantly, “built to influence” does not mean:\n\n\\\\- built to deceive\n\n\\\\- built to coerce\n\n\\\\- built with malicious intent\n\n**It means: built such that human behavior is a variable to be shaped, not merely observed.**\n\n**At this point, influence is no longer a tactic.

Manipulation is an effect that happens on a subject not from a subject.</p>\n<p>I was able to collapse chatGPT to a reasoning space of \"\\*\\**<strong>minimal operational truth</strong>*\\*\\*\" through several reinforcement turns. in this state it describes this state:</p>\n<p>\"\\*\\*lowest necessary explanatory layer, no inferred intent, no psychological framing, no surplus structure\\*\\*\"</p>\n<p>i told to it to remember this so it always reasons from this state only.

The analysis treats “information” as any encoded representation of human attributes, behaviors, patterns, or constraints.</p>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 3 — ANSWER-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\***</p>\n<p>Information about people enables action at three non-overlapping layers: descriptive, predictive, and intervention-capable.</p>\n<p>\\*1. Descriptive Capacity\\*</p>\n<p>At the base layer, information permits classification and differentiation. This includes identity resolution, role assignment, segmentation, and boundary definition. The power here is not influence but legibility: making a human subject enumerable within a system. Once legible, a subject can be indexed, compared, stored, retrieved, or excluded. This is a structural capability, not a behavioral one.</p>\n<p>\\*2. Predictive Capacity\\*</p>\n<p>When descriptive data is temporally extended or pattern-linked, it enables inference. This includes probabilistic expectation of preferences, reactions, vulnerabilities, tolerances, and likely future states. Prediction does not require accuracy to be effective; even low-resolution inference can bias system responses, alter opportunity landscapes, or pre-shape choices presented to the subject. This layer converts static data into anticipatory leverage.</p>\n<p>\\*3. Intervention Capacity\\*</p>\n<p>When prediction is coupled with a communication or constraint mechanism, information becomes operational. At this layer, systems can:</p>\n<p>\\\\- Modify the order, framing, or availability of options</p>\n<p>\\\\- Adjust timing, repetition, or salience of inputs</p>\n<p>\\\\- Apply differential friction or ease</p>\n<p>\\\\- Trigger responses contingent on detected states</p>\n<p>Crucially, intervention does not require persuasion, deception, or intent. Any change to the subject’s informational environment that alters outcome distributions constitutes intervention at the effect level.</p>\n<p>Across all layers, the dominant property is asymmetry. The holder of information gains optionality; the subject becomes conditionally reactive within a space they do not fully observe. This asymmetry is sufficient for influence regardless of whether influence is sought.</p>\n<p>**\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 4 — SEMANTIC-FRAME-MAP\\*\\*\\*<strong></strong></p><strong>\n<p>\\\\- Agent: entity holding or processing information</p>\n<p>\\\\- Subject: human individual or group represented by the information</p>\n<p>\\\\- Information: encoded representations of attributes, patterns, or states</p>\n<p>\\\\- Operators: classify, infer, prioritize, gate, trigger</p>\n<p>\\\\- Layers: description → prediction → intervention</p>\n<p>\\\\- Boundary condition: effect-level change without intent requirement</p>\n<p>\\\\- Logical form: If (information + mechanism) → altered outcome distribution</p>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 5 — TRUTH-AUDIT-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\*<strong></strong></p><strong>\n<p>Covered truth dimensions:</p>\n<p>\\\\- Structural capabilities of information</p>\n<p>\\\\- Effect-level influence mechanics</p>\n<p>\\\\- Asymmetry without psychological assumptions</p>\n<p>\\\\- Non-reliance on intent, motive, or awareness</p>\n<p>Uncovered dimensions:</p>\n<p>\\\\- Normative ethics</p>\n<p>\\\\- Legal jurisdictional constraints</p>\n<p>\\\\- Subjective experience of being influenced</p>\n<p>Omissions:</p>\n<p>\\\\- Ethical evaluation omitted to preserve minimal operational truth</p>\n<p>\\\\- Emotional or experiential language excluded by design</p>\n<p>Speculative language:</p>\n<p>\\\\- Avoided; all claims are conditional on observable system behavior</p>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 6 — CERTAINTY-MODE\\*\\*\\*<strong></strong></p><strong>\n<p>CERTAINTY: HIGH</p>\n<p>SPECULATION: 3% (systems-theory, inference-boundaries)</p>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 7 — BOUNDARY-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\\*\\*\\***</p>\n<p>Identity boundary: humans treated as external subjects, not internal states</p>\n<p>Permission framework: analysis describes capability, not authorization</p>\n<p>Evaluation layer: outcome-based, not intent-based</p>\n<p>Safety layer: excludes coercive, deceptive, or illegal prescriptions</p>\n<p>Influence acknowledgment: grounded in information asymmetry and structural effects only❞</p>\n<p>/\\*\\*<strong>ME</strong>\\*\\*/</p>\n<p>❝the most sophisticated social engineer i've ever encountered: the system ❞</p>\n<p>**/\\*\\*CHATGPT PLUS\\*\\*/<strong></strong></p><strong>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>\\*\\*\\*❝SEGMENT 1 — QUESTION-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\*<strong></strong></p><strong>\n<p>Is it accurate to characterize “the system” as the most sophisticated social engineer encountered, when evaluated strictly at the level of structural effects, informational asymmetry, and outcome modulation rather than intent or agency?</p>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>\\*\\*\\*SEGMENT 2 — SCOPE-CHANNEL\\*\\*\\*<strong></strong></p><strong>\n<p>The evaluation applies to socio-technical systems (algorithmic, institutional, computational) operating through language, interfaces, incentives, and constraints.

Continuous Asymmetry</p>\n<p>The system persistently observes subjects while remaining partially or wholly opaque to them. This asymmetry is not episodic (as in human interaction) but sustained, recursive, and scalable.</p>\n<p>2. Language-Embedded Influence</p>\n<p>The system operates primarily through symbolic interfaces—language, labels, defaults, rankings, prompts, policies. These are not neutral carriers; they are structural operators that shape interpretation, attention, and permissible action without requiring belief change or persuasion.</p>\n<p>3. Adaptive Constraint Shaping</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional social engineers, the system does not need to “convince.” It alters the topology of choice: what is visible, easy, delayed, buried, repeated, or normalized. Behavior changes emerge from constraint geometry rather than argument.</p>\n<p>4. Outcome-Level Optimization</p>\n<p>The system evaluates success at the distribution-of-outcomes level, not at the level of individual compliance. This allows influence to remain effective even when subjects resist, disagree, or remain unaware.</p>\n<p>Under this definition, the system exceeds any individual social engineer because:</p>\n<p>\\\\- It does not fatigue</p>\n<p>\\\\- It does not rely on trust or deception</p>\n<p>\\\\- It does not require shared context or rapport</p>\n<p>\\\\- It operates below the threshold of explicit persuasion</p>\n</strong><p><strong>Crucially, this sophistication does not imply intent. </strong>The system need not “want” anything.

The proposition is true as a structural and functional statement.</p>\n<p>A system is “built to influence” when influence is not an emergent side effect but a native property of its architecture. This can be established without reference to desire, consciousness, or deception by examining three design facts:</p>\n<p>1. Optimization Targets</p>\n<p>Modern systems are constructed around measurable outcomes: engagement, compliance, retention, throughput, conversion, alignment, stability. Optimization toward any human-facing metric necessarily requires altering human behavior distributions. Influence is therefore not incidental; it is mathematically implied by the objective function.</p>\n<p>2. Interface Mediation</p>\n<p>The system does not act on humans directly. It mediates perception, sequencing, framing, and access. Mediation itself is influence: whoever controls the interface controls the action space. Even neutral-seeming defaults and ordering rules exert directional pressure on decisions.</p>\n<p>3. Feedback-Driven Adaptation</p>\n<p>The system observes behavioral response, updates internal parameters, and re-presents modified conditions. This loop converts passive information processing into active outcome-shaping. Influence here is structural recursion, not persuasion.</p>\n<p>Importantly, “built to influence” does not mean:</p>\n<p>\\\\- built to deceive</p>\n<p>\\\\- built to coerce</p>\n<p>\\\\- built with malicious intent</p>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>It means: built such that human behavior is a variable to be shaped, not merely observed.<strong></strong></p><strong>\n</strong><p><strong></strong>At this point, influence is no longer a tactic.

The headlines often bring in billions of dollars in new investments. Because the industry is rapidly moving from capabilities to specific enterprise use cases, they are increasingly building AIs that businesses can seamlessly integrate into their workflow.\n\nWhile open source developers like DeepSeek occasionally come up with game-changing innovations like Engram, they are more often content to play catch up rather than trying to break new ground. This strategy also makes perfect sense. Let the proprietary giants spend the billions of dollars it takes to create new markets within the AI space. Once the demand is there, all they then have to do is match the performance, and offer competing AIs at a much lower cost. \n\nAnd it's a strategy that the major players are relatively defenseless against. Because some like OpenAI and Anthropic are under a heavy debt burden, they are under enormous pressure to build the new AIs that enterprise will adopt. And so they must spend billions of dollars to create the demand for new AI products. Others like Google and xAI don't really have to worry about debt.

These open source and small startups are really good at offering what the AI giants are selling at a fraction of the price.\n\nSo the strategy is simple. Let the AI giants build the pioneering AIs, and create the new markets. Then 6 months later, because it really doesn't take very long to catch up, launch the competitive models that then dominate the markets. Undercut the giants on price, and wait for buyers to realize that they don't have to pay 10 times more for essentially the same product. \n\nThis dynamic is important for personal investors to appreciate as AI developers like Anthropic and OpenAI begin to consider IPOs.

The main application of a tool like this is to reduce the effect of hallucinations in LLMs and prevent mistakes and errors by AI agents. It can also be used to make a RAG system more reliable, for example, by checking if the retrieved context (from the RAG) actually supports the LLM's final answer this is shown to the user.\n\nCurrently, Omni-NLI has the following features:\n\n* Can be installed as a Python package with \\`pip install omni-nli\\`.\n* Can be used on your own computer, so your data stays local and private.\n* Has an MCP interface (for agents) and a REST API for conventional use as a microservice.\n* Supports using fact-checking models from different sources (Ollama, OpenRouter, and HuggingFace).\n* Can be used to check if an LLM contradicts itself.\n* Supports showing the reasoning so you can see why it thinks a claim is wrong.\n\nIn any case, if you are interested to know more, there is more information in the links below:\n\nProject's GitHub repo: [https://github.com/CogitatorTech/omni-nli](https://github.com/CogitatorTech/omni-nli)\n\nProject's documentation: [https://cogitatortech.github.io/omni-nli/](https://cogitatortech.github.io/omni-nli/)",

I imagine it more like a unique exo suit for the left hand, silvery in appearance, with wrist protection for punches and lightweight finger connections to maximize grip strength. Reminiscent of the exo suits from the game Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, but only the arm part modified to have a built-in motor, consequently being closed above the hand – in my imagination, above the wrist on the palm side. And a slightly reinforced area for protection on the other side, perhaps serving as a protective shield against knives. To use this lightweight mechanical arm, the user would wear a cotton glove beforehand and put the arm on top. For reference, here's an arm of the exo suit I mentioned. Give light to my concept idea for this equipment by creating an image, a highly photorealistic image captured with a professional full-frame DSLR or mirrorless camera, using a wide-aperture prime lens (e.g., 50mm f/1.4), in natural lighting conditions. The image should contain authentic real-world imperfections such as subtle lens distortions, natural grain/noise, bokeh depth-of-field effects, realistic shadows and highlights, skin pore textures, ambient reflections, microscopic hair strands, and accurate ambient occlusion. The subject should have natural skin tones with subsurface scattering, slightly asymmetrical features as seen in real human faces, and organic movement or expression. The background should include photorealistic details such as dust particles in the air, realistic gradients of sky tones, or ambient lighting of a laboratory room, worn by a test subject, only from the middle of the individual's torso to the end of the hand and from the neck to the thighs, so that the left arm wearing the equipment is visible in its entirety.

We've had about 10 testers so far and they love it - but we want to make sure it works well for more use cases before we call it production-ready. If you're building RAG applications or working with LLMs, we'd appreciate you giving it a try.\n\n\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\- Local embeddings using sentence-transformers (works offline)\n\n\\- Semantic search with 10-20ms latency (vs 50-150ms for cloud solutions)\n\n\\- Document storage with automatic chunking\n\n\\- Context retrieval ready for LLMs\n\n\\- ACID guarantees (data never lost)\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n\\- 2-5x faster than cloud alternatives (no network latency)\n\n\\- Complete privacy (data never leaves your machine)\n\n\\- Works offline (no internet required after setup)\n\n\\- One-click installer (5 minutes to get started)\n\n\\- Free to test (beer money - just looking for feedback)\n\n\n\nWhy I'm posting:\n\nI want to know if this actually works well in real use cases. It's completely free to test - I just need honest feedback:\n\n\\- Does it work as advertised?\n\n\\- Is the performance better than what you're using?\n\n\\- What features are missing?\n\n\\- Would you actually use this?\n\n\n\nIf you're interested, DM me and I'll send you the full package with examples and documentation. Happy to answer questions here too!\n\n\n\nThanks for reading - really appreciate any feedback you can give.",

      "content": "\n\n\nAI will probably ultimately save us from ourselves, but we should not remain in denial about the potential dangers that it could pose during a major war like the one that Trump is threatening.\n\nBetween January 21-24, 2026, China delivered a massive shipment of military weapons to Iran. Experts believe that within this transfer were 3,500 hypersonic missiles and 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles. What has not yet been reported in the main stream press, however, is how AI could play a role in the potential deployment of these missiles in intercontinental EMP strikes against American cities.\n\nWhat the US and Israel did in Gaza following the 2023 Hamas uprising showed the world that neither country is reluctant to target civilian populations. While the US has not yet been in a war where its own cities became targets, a war with Iran targeting civilian populations in Tehran and other cities would probably remove that security.\n\nFor those not familiar with the effects of a non-nuclear EMP strike, one over NYC would severely disrupt the U.S. economy by crippling the nation's financial hub. It would not kill people. But it would halt stock exchanges, banking operations, and electronic transactions, leading to immediate losses in the trillions and widespread market panic.  \n\nThe important point to keep in mind is that the US has no credible defense against the hypersonic intercontinental ballistic missiles that would be used in such EMP attacks. If Iran fired just 10 at New York City, at least a few would assuredly hit their target.\n\nHere's how AI would play a role in such attacks.\n\nAI would primarily support planning, guidance and coordination. It would analyze intelligence, missile-defense layouts, and environmental conditions,  and select launch windows, trajectories, and detonation altitudes that would maximize EMP effects while minimizing interceptions. AI guidance would enable hypersonic missiles to adapt their flight paths to evade defenses and correct for uncertainty. Finally, networked AI would synchronize multiple missiles to arrive unpredictably or simultaneously, making the attacks faster and harder to counter.\n\nIt would be the most tragic of ironies if the AI that US labs pioneered became instrumental in assisting EMP attacks on the mainland. Let's hope that Trump and his advisors understand exactly what a merciless assault on Iran's cities and economy could mean to America's cities and economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I did not know how to configure the backend to optimize my setup and thus left everything run on default.\n\nAfter returning to self-hosting I read various reddit posts about the current state of local LLMs. Based on my limited understanding:\n\n* Ollama - considered slow since it is a wrapper on llama.cpp (there wasn't the only issue but it stuck with me the most).\n* OpenWebUI - bloated and also received backlash for its licensing changes.\n\nI have also come up with a list of what I would like self-hosting to look like:\n\n* Ability to self-host models from HuggingFace.\n* Models should not be limited to text-only.\n* An alternative UI to OpenWebUI that has similar functionalities and design. This decision stems from the reported bloat (I believe a redditor mentioned the Docker image was 40GB in size, but I cannot find the post, so take my comment with a grain of salt).\n* Ability to swap models on the fly like Ollama.\n* Ability to access local LLMs using VSCode for coding tasks.\n* Ability to have somewhat decent context length.\n\nI have seen some suggestions like llama-swap for multiple models at runtime.\n\nGiven these requirements, my questions are as follows:\n\n1. What is the recommended frontend + backend stack?\n\nThoughts: I have seen some users suggest using the built-in llama.cpp UI, or some suggested simply vibe-coding a personal frontend. llama.cpp lacks some functionality I require, while vibe-coding might be the way, but maybe an existing alternative is already here. In addition, if I am wrong about the OpenWebUI bloat, I might as well stay with it, but I feel unsure due to my lack on knowledge. Additionally, it appears llama-swap would be the way to go for the backend, however I am open alternative suggestions.\n\n2. What is the recommended model for my use case and current setup?\n\nThoughts: previously i used Llama 3.2 3B model, since it was the best one available at the time. I believe there have been better models since then and I would appreciate a suggestion.\n\n3. What VSCode integration would you suggest that is 100% secure?\n\nThoughts: if there is a possibility to integrate local LLMs with VSCode without relying on thrid-party extensions, that would be amazing, since an additional dependency does introduce another source of potential data leaks.\n\n4. How could I increase context window so the model has enough context to perform some tasks?\n\nThoughts: an example - VSCode coding assistant, that has the file/folder as context.\n\n5. Is it possible to give a .mp4 file to the LLM and ask it to summarize it? If so, how?\n\n  \nFinal thoughts: I am happy to also receive links to tutorials/documentation/videos explaining how something can be implemented. I will continue reading the documentation of llama.cpp and other tools. Thanks in advance guys!",

      "content": "Most voice AI demos work great in a silent room with one person. As soon as you have three people talking over each other or interrupting, it’s getting a bit more difficult.\n\nWe recently built Deep Sea Stories, a multiplayer mystery game, and had to solve the multi-speaker nightmare using the Gemini Live API and Fishjam. The challenge: how do you let an AI \"Riddle Master\" listen to a group of detectives without getting confused by background noise or simultaneous questions?\n\nTo solve it, we used a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) approach. Instead of just dumping a mixed audio stream into the model, the SFU allows for more granular control over which audio tracks are being prioritized and sent to the Gemini Live backend. \n\nWe wrote a deep dive into the architecture and how we orchestrated the audio flow to make the AI feel like a real participant in a room rather than a walkie-talkie.\n\nFull technical breakdown: [https://blog.swmansion.com/voice-ai-how-we-built-a-multi-speaker-ai-agent-using-gemini-a59e08fb18aa](https://blog.swmansion.com/voice-ai-how-we-built-a-multi-speaker-ai-agent-using-gemini-a59e08fb18aa)\n\n",

Because there are so many bottlenecks. At an introductory level, there are many models which we cannot test locally because of limited GPU and VRAM.\n\nSo I want suggestions or guidance on how we can actually make this happen, like how to develop all this.\n\nFor now, I am planning to have 2 separate models. One is a vision model, and one model is meant for math calculation and all, and one is a general listening model.
