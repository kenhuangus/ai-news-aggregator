      "content": "Anthropic launched MCP Apps this week.\n\nThis enables a new class of applications using Generative UI.\n\nHere is the thing:\n\nChatbots are dumb. You can't build a serious application for humans without these:\n\n• Progress indicators\n• Status updates\n• Confirmations\n\nUX is still important, and this new wave of \"everything is a chatbot\" is learning this lesson the hard way.\n\nGenerative UI will be the next big thing.\n\nAgents must be part of the UI, not just the conversation.\n\nPeople don't want to read a dump of text responses. Instead, we want agents to drive cards, tables, forms, progress indicators, and confirmation dialogs.\n\nThe agent decides intent. Your application will render it visually.\n\nThink about it this way:\n\n1. Your agent will express what UI should exist\n2. Your frontend will decide how to render it\n\nHere's how the pieces fit together:\n\n1. The A2UI and MCP-UI specifications define what an agent wants to show. They're declarative descriptions of components, interactions, and how user input flows back to the agent.\n\n2. AG-UI is the transport layer. It handles streaming updates, shared state between agent and frontend, tool calls, and bidirectional communication.\n\n3.

If it was possible to get rewards inside the planning horizon of some dozens of steps, it could often find them, but the behavior was often “shortsighted”. There were several tasks where PlaNet didn’t do any better than random at an action repeat of 2, because it took more than a couple seconds of behavior to score. They crutched around it by using larger action repeats on those tasks in the original paper, but re-ran them all with a fixed action repeat in the tables here.\n\nTraditional RL algorithms like Q learning and SARSA can propagate rewards far back in time using temporal difference learning and state or action value functions.\n\nDreamer basically adds traditional RL policy and value functions for the latent states, and learns them strictly in the imagined state transitions instead of from the online real environment interactions. This allows long term credit assignment like the model-free agents, but exploration can still happen in imaginary traces without having to test them in the environment (which can sometimes be misleading).\n\nSome of their terminology confused me for a bit relative to other RL papers: What they call an “action model” I expected to be called a “policy model” (although action model might be better terminology!), and they predict a “discount factor” as a measure of the chance of an episode terminating, but discount factor usually refers to the exponential gamma factor in target bootstrap calculations.\n\nThey do a TD-lambda style weighting of all the possible imagined trajectory lengths to get their bootstrap targets, and they do stochastic backpropagation through the entire imagined trajectory to account for the stochastic action model decisions.\n\nFor learning the world dynamics models (in real experience, not in imagination), they predict latent-to-latent, but the loss is the pixel reconstruction from the predicted latent to the real observation. They experimented with contrastive estimation and pure reward prediction, but pixel reconstruction is simplest and worked best. It is basically like an autoencoder across multiple latent steps before going back to pixels.\n\nThe policy model is a little unusual: “The action model outputs a tanh mean scaled by a factor of 5 and a softplus standard deviation for the Normal distribution that is then transformed using tanh (Haarnoja et al., 2018). The scaling factor allows the agent to saturate the action distribution.”\n\nIn addition to the continuous control tasks from PlaNet, they also test on a subset of discrete control tasks from Atari and DMLab. I always smile at the use of the DeepMind Lab (DMLab) benchmarks, which were built on Quake 3, but with all the violence removed. These more complex tasks only use an imagination horizon of 10 instead of 50, presumably because the model was counterproductively bad beyond that horizon.",
