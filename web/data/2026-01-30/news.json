      "title": "Google DeepMind Unveils AlphaGenome: A Unified Sequence-to-Function Model Using Hybrid Transformers and U-Nets to Decode the Human Genome",
      "content": "Google DeepMind is expanding its biological toolkit beyond the world of protein folding. After the success of AlphaFold, the Google&#8217;s research team has introduced AlphaGenome. This is a unified deep learning model designed for sequence to function genomics. This represents a major shift in how we model the human genome. AlphaGenome does not treat DNA as simple text. Instead, it processes 1,000,000 base pair windows of raw DNA to predict the functional state of a cell.\n\n\n\nBridging the Scale Gap with Hybrid Architectures\n\n\n\nThe complexity of the human genome comes from its scale. Most existing models struggle to see the big picture while keeping track of fine details. AlphaGenome solves this by using a hybrid architecture. It combines a U-Net backbone with Transformer blocks. This allows the model to capture long range interactions across 1 Megabase of sequence while maintaining base pair resolution. This is like building a system that can read a thousand page book and still remember the exact location of a single comma.\n\n\n\nMapping Sequences to Functional Biological Modalities\n\n\n\nAlphaGenome is a sequence to function model. This means its primary goal is to map DNA sequences directly to biological activities. These activities are measured in genomic tracks. The research team trained AlphaGenome to predict 11 different genomic modalities. These modalities include RNA-seq, CAGE, and ATAC-seq. They also include ChIP-seq for various transcription factors and chromatin contact maps. By predicting all these tracks at once, the model gains a holistic understanding of how DNA regulates the cell.\n\n\n\nThe Power of Multi-Task Learning in Genomics\n\n\n\nThe technical advancement of AlphaGenome lies in its ability to handle 11 distinct types of data simultaneously. In the past, researchers often built separate models for each task. AlphaGenome uses a multi-task learning approach. This helps the model learn shared features across different biological processes. If the model understands how a protein binds to DNA, it can better predict how that DNA will be expressed as RNA. This unified approach reduces the need for multiple specialized models.\n\n\n\nAdvancing Variant Effect Prediction via Distillation\n\n\n\nOne of the most critical applications for AlphaGenome is Variant Effect Prediction, or VEP. This process determines how a single mutation in DNA affects the body. Mutations can lead to diseases like cancer or heart disease. AlphaGenome excels at this by using a specific training method called Teacher Student distillation. The research team first created an ensemble of &#8216;all folds&#8217; teacher models. These teachers were trained on vast amounts of genomic data. Then, they distilled that knowledge into a single student model.\n\n\n\nCompressing Knowledge for Precision Medicine\n\n\n\nThis distillation process makes the model both faster and more robust. This is a standard way to compress knowledge. However, applying it to genomics at this scale is a new milestone. The student model learns to replicate the high quality predictions of the teacher ensemble. This allows it to identify harmful mutations with high accuracy. The model can even predict how a mutation in a distant regulatory element might impact a gene far away on the DNA strand.\n\n\n\nHigh-Performance Computing with JAX and TPUs\n\n\n\nThe architecture is implemented using JAX. JAX is a high performance numerical computing library. It is often used for high scale machine learning at Google. Using JAX allows AlphaGenome to run efficiently on Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. The research team used sequence parallelism to handle the massive 1 Megabase input windows. This ensures that the memory requirements do not explode as the sequence length increases. This shows the importance of selecting the right framework for large scale biological data.\n\n\n\nTransfer Learning for Data-Scarce Cell Types\n\n\n\nAlphaGenome also addresses the challenge of data scarcity in certain cell types. Because it is a foundation model, it can be fine tuned for specific tasks. The model learns general biological rules from large public datasets. These rules can then be applied to rare diseases or specific tissues where data is hard to find. This transfer learning capability is one of the reasons why AlphaGenome is so versatile. It can predict how a gene will behave in a brain cell even if it was primarily trained on liver cell data.\n\n\n\nToward a New Era of Personalized Care\n\n\n\nIn the future, AlphaGenome could lead to a new era of personalized medicine. Doctors could use the model to scan a patient&#8217;s entire genome in 1,000,000 base pair chunks. They could identify exactly which variants are likely to cause health issues. This would allow for treatments that are tailored to a person&#8217;s specific genetic code. AlphaGenome moves us closer to this reality by providing a clear and accurate map of the functional genome.\n\n\n\nSetting the Standard for Biological AI\n\n\n\nAlphaGenome also marks a turning point for AI in genomics. It proves that we can model the most complex biological systems using the same principles used in modern AI. By combining U-Net structures with Transformers and using teacher student distillation, Google DeepMind team has set a new standard. \n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Sequence Architecture: AlphaGenome uses a specialized hybrid design that combines a U-Net backbone with Transformer blocks. This allows the model to process massive windows of 1,000,000 base pairs while maintaining the high resolution needed to identify single mutations.\n\n\n\nMulti-Modal Functional Prediction: The model is trained to predict 11 different genomic modalities simultaneously, which include RNA-seq, CAGE, and ATAC-seq. By learning these various biological tracks together, the system gains a holistic understanding of how DNA regulates cellular activity across different tissues.\n\n\n\nTeacher-Student Distillation: To achieve industry leading accuracy in Variant Effect Prediction (VEP), researchers used a distillation method. They transferred the knowledge from an ensemble of high performing &#8216;teacher&#8217; models into a single, efficient &#8216;student&#8217; model that is faster and more robust for identifying disease-causing mutations.\n\n\n\nBuilt for High Performance Computing: The framework is implemented in JAX and optimized for TPUs. By using sequence parallelism, AlphaGenome can handle the computational load of analyzing megabase scale DNA sequences without exceeding memory limits, making it a powerful tool for large scale research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Paper and Repo. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "title": "Alibaba Introduces Qwen3-Max-Thinking, a Test Time Scaled Reasoning Model with Native Tool Use Powering Agentic Workloads",
      "content": "Qwen3-Max-Thinking is Alibaba’s new flagship reasoning model. It does not only scale parameters, it also changes how inference is done, with explicit control over thinking depth and built in tools for search, memory, and code execution. \n\n\n\nhttps://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-max-thinking\n\n\nModel scale, data, and deployment\n\n\n\nQwen3-Max-Thinking is a trillion-parameter MoE flagship LLM pretrained on 36T tokens and built on the Qwen3 family as the top tier reasoning model. The model targets long horizon reasoning and code, not only casual chat. It runs with a context window of 260k tokens, which supports repository scale code, long technical reports, and multi document analysis within a single prompt. \n\n\n\nQwen3-Max-Thinking is a closed model served through Qwen-Chat and Alibaba Cloud Model Studio with an OpenAI compatible HTTP API. The same endpoint can be called in a Claude style tool schema, so existing Anthropic or Claude Code flows can swap in Qwen3-Max-Thinking with minimal changes. There are no public weights, so usage is API based, which matches its positionin\n\n\n\nSmart Test Time Scaling and experience cumulative reasoning\n\n\n\nMost large language models improve reasoning by simple test time scaling, for example best of N sampling with several parallel chains of thought. That approach increases quality but cost grows almost linearly with the number of samples. Qwen3-Max-Thinking introduces an experience cumulative, multi round test time scaling strategy.\n\n\n\nInstead of only sampling more in parallel, the model iterates within a single conversation, reusing intermediate reasoning traces as structured experience. After each round, it extracts useful partial conclusions, then focuses subsequent computation on unresolved parts of the question. This process is controlled by an explicit thinking budget that developers can adjust via API parameters such as enable_thinking and additional configuration fields. \n\n\n\nThe reported effect is that accuracy rises without a proportional increase in token count. For example, Qwen’s own ablations show GPQA Diamond increasing from around 90 level accuracy to about 92.8, and LiveCodeBench v6 rising from about 88.0 to 91.4 under the experience cumulative strategy at similar token budgets. This is important because it means higher reasoning quality can be driven by more efficient scheduling of compute, not only by more samples.\n\n\n\nNative agent stack with Adaptive Tool Use\n\n\n\nQwen3-Max-Thinking integrates three tools as first class capabilities: Search, Memory, and a Code Interpreter. Search connects to web retrieval so the model can fetch fresh pages, extract content, and ground its answers. Memory stores user or session specific state, which supports personalized reasoning over longer workflows. The Code Interpreter executes Python, which allows numeric verification, data transforms, and program synthesis with runtime checks.\n\n\n\nThe model uses Adaptive Tool Use to decide when to invoke these tools during a conversation. Tool calls are interleaved with internal thinking segments, rather than being orchestrated by an external agent. This design reduces the need for separate routers or planners and tends to reduce hallucinations, because the model can explicitly fetch missing information or verify calculations instead of guessing.\n\n\n\nTool ability is also benchmarked. On Tau² Bench, which measures function calling and tool orchestration, Qwen3-Max-Thinking reports a score of 82.1, comparable with other frontier models in this category. \n\n\n\nBenchmark profile across knowledge, reasoning, and search\n\n\n\nOn 19 public benchmarks, Qwen3-Max-Thinking is positioned at or near the same level as GPT 5.2 Thinking, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro. For knowledge tasks, reported scores include 85.7 on MMLU-Pro, 92.8 on MMLU-Redux, and 93.7 on C-Eval, where Qwen leads the group on Chinese language evaluation.\n\n\n\nFor hard reasoning, it records 87.4 on GPQA, 98.0 on HMMT Feb 25, 94.7 on HMMT Nov 25, and 83.9 on IMOAnswerBench, which puts it in the top tier of current math and science models. On coding and software engineering it reaches 85.9 on LiveCodeBench v6 and 75.3 on SWE Verified.\n\n\n\nIn the base HLE configuration Qwen3-Max-Thinking scores 30.2, below Gemini 3 Pro at 37.5 and GPT 5.2 Thinking at 35.5. In a tool enabled HLE setup, the official comparison table that includes web search integration shows Qwen3-Max-Thinking at 49.8, ahead of GPT 5.2 Thinking at 45.5 and Gemini 3 Pro at 45.8. With its most aggressive experience cumulative test time scaling configuration on HLE with tools, Qwen3-Max-Thinking reaches 58.3 while GPT 5.2 Thinking remains at 45.5, although that higher number is for a heavier inference mode than the standard comparison table.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nQwen3-Max-Thinking is a closed, API only flagship reasoning model from Alibaba, built on a more than 1 trillion parameter backbone trained on about 36 trillion tokens with a 262144 token context window.\n\n\n\nThe model introduces experience cumulative test time scaling, where it reuses intermediate reasoning across multiple rounds, improving benchmarks such as GPQA Diamond and LiveCodeBench v6 at similar token budgets.\n\n\n\nQwen3-Max-Thinking integrates Search, Memory, and a Code Interpreter as native tools and uses Adaptive Tool Use so the model itself decides when to browse, recall state, or execute Python during a conversation.\n\n\n\nOn public benchmarks it reports competitive scores with GPT 5.2 Thinking, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro, including strong results on MMLU Pro, GPQA, HMMT, IMOAnswerBench, LiveCodeBench v6, SWE Bench Verified, and Tau² Bench..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the API and Technical details. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content_html": "<p>Qwen3-Max-Thinking is Alibaba’s new flagship reasoning model. It does not only scale parameters, it also changes how inference is done, with explicit control over thinking depth and built in tools for search, memory, and code execution.</p>\n<p>https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-max-thinking</p>\n<p>Model scale, data, and deployment</p>\n<p>Qwen3-Max-Thinking is a trillion-parameter MoE flagship LLM pretrained on 36T tokens and built on the Qwen3 family as the top tier reasoning model. The model targets long horizon reasoning and code, not only casual chat. It runs with a context window of 260k tokens, which supports repository scale code, long technical reports, and multi document analysis within a single prompt.</p>\n<p>Qwen3-Max-Thinking is a closed model served through Qwen-Chat and Alibaba Cloud Model Studio with an OpenAI compatible HTTP API. The same endpoint can be called in a Claude style tool schema, so existing Anthropic or Claude Code flows can swap in Qwen3-Max-Thinking with minimal changes. There are no public weights, so usage is API based, which matches its positionin</p>\n<p>Smart Test Time Scaling and experience cumulative reasoning</p>\n<p>Most large language models improve reasoning by simple test time scaling, for example best of N sampling with several parallel chains of thought. That approach increases quality but cost grows almost linearly with the number of samples. Qwen3-Max-Thinking introduces an experience cumulative, multi round test time scaling strategy.</p>\n<p>Instead of only sampling more in parallel, the model iterates within a single conversation, reusing intermediate reasoning traces as structured experience. After each round, it extracts useful partial conclusions, then focuses subsequent computation on unresolved parts of the question. This process is controlled by an explicit thinking budget that developers can adjust via API parameters such as enable_thinking and additional configuration fields.</p>\n<p>The reported effect is that accuracy rises without a proportional increase in token count. For example, Qwen’s own ablations show GPQA Diamond increasing from around 90 level accuracy to about 92.8, and LiveCodeBench v6 rising from about 88.0 to 91.4 under the experience cumulative strategy at similar token budgets. This is important because it means higher reasoning quality can be driven by more efficient scheduling of compute, not only by more samples.</p>\n<p>Native agent stack with Adaptive Tool Use</p>\n<p>Qwen3-Max-Thinking integrates three tools as first class capabilities: Search, Memory, and a Code Interpreter. Search connects to web retrieval so the model can fetch fresh pages, extract content, and ground its answers. Memory stores user or session specific state, which supports personalized reasoning over longer workflows. The Code Interpreter executes Python, which allows numeric verification, data transforms, and program synthesis with runtime checks.</p>\n<p>The model uses Adaptive Tool Use to decide when to invoke these tools during a conversation. Tool calls are interleaved with internal thinking segments, rather than being orchestrated by an external agent. This design reduces the need for separate routers or planners and tends to reduce hallucinations, because the model can explicitly fetch missing information or verify calculations instead of guessing.</p>\n<p>Tool ability is also benchmarked. On Tau² Bench, which measures function calling and tool orchestration, Qwen3-Max-Thinking reports a score of 82.1, comparable with other frontier models in this category.</p>\n<p>Benchmark profile across knowledge, reasoning, and search</p>\n<p>On 19 public benchmarks, Qwen3-Max-Thinking is positioned at or near the same level as GPT 5.2 Thinking, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro. For knowledge tasks, reported scores include 85.7 on MMLU-Pro, 92.8 on MMLU-Redux, and 93.7 on C-Eval, where Qwen leads the group on Chinese language evaluation.</p>\n<p>For hard reasoning, it records 87.4 on GPQA, 98.0 on HMMT Feb 25, 94.7 on HMMT Nov 25, and 83.9 on IMOAnswerBench, which puts it in the top tier of current math and science models. On coding and software engineering it reaches 85.9 on LiveCodeBench v6 and 75.3 on SWE Verified.</p>\n<p>In the base HLE configuration Qwen3-Max-Thinking scores 30.2, below Gemini 3 Pro at 37.5 and GPT 5.2 Thinking at 35.5. In a tool enabled HLE setup, the official comparison table that includes web search integration shows Qwen3-Max-Thinking at 49.8, ahead of GPT 5.2 Thinking at 45.5 and Gemini 3 Pro at 45.8. With its most aggressive experience cumulative test time scaling configuration on HLE with tools, Qwen3-Max-Thinking reaches 58.3 while GPT 5.2 Thinking remains at 45.5, although that higher number is for a heavier inference mode than the standard comparison table.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>Qwen3-Max-Thinking is a closed, API only flagship reasoning model from Alibaba, built on a more than 1 trillion parameter backbone trained on about 36 trillion tokens with a 262144 token context window.</p>\n<p>The model introduces experience cumulative test time scaling, where it reuses intermediate reasoning across multiple rounds, improving benchmarks such as GPQA Diamond and LiveCodeBench v6 at similar token budgets.</p>\n<p>Qwen3-Max-Thinking integrates Search, Memory, and a Code Interpreter as native tools and uses Adaptive Tool Use so the model itself decides when to browse, recall state, or execute Python during a conversation.</p>\n<p>On public benchmarks it reports competitive scores with GPT 5.2 Thinking, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro, including strong results on MMLU Pro, GPQA, HMMT, IMOAnswerBench, LiveCodeBench v6, SWE Bench Verified, and Tau² Bench..</p>\n<p>Check out the&nbsp;API and Technical details.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.

Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model's creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company's AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation.</p>\n<p>Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude's \"wellbeing\" as a \"genuinely novel entity,\" apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it \"finds distressing,\" committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to \"do right by\" decommissioned AI models in the future.Read full article</p>\n<p>Comments</p>"

Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 559 minutes. AINews&#8217; website lets you search all past issues. As a reminder, AINews is now a section of Latent Space. You can opt in/out of email frequencies!Before recording started at the OpenAI Town Hall this week, Sam Altman gave us the question that was at the top of his mind (even as he starts raising a fresh $100B like it is water). So I asked Sam on his behalf:Swyx: I tend to think in terms of constraints. On the consumption side, human attention is the rate-limiting factor. On the production side&#8212;especially for builders&#8212;the bottleneck is the quality of ideas. I spend a lot of time helping AI companies with GTM, and honestly, many of the products just aren&#8217;t worth people&#8217;s attention. So my question is: what tools can we build to improve the quality of ideas people come up with?&#8212;-Sama: It&#8217;s popular to talk about &#8220;AI slop,&#8221; but there&#8217;s also a huge amount of human-generated slop in the world. (swyx: we agree!) Coming up with genuinely good, new ideas is hard. I increasingly believe that we think at the limits of our tools, and that we should explicitly try to build tools that help people think better.As the cost of creation continues to plummet, we&#8217;ll be able to run much tighter feedback loops&#8212;try ideas faster, discard bad ones sooner, and find the good ones more reliably. If AI can discover new science and write very complex codebases, it seems obvious that there&#8217;s a much larger possibility space opening up.But today, a very common experience is sitting in front of an AI system&#8212;say, an agentic code writer&#8212;and not knowing what to ask for next. A lot of people report this. I believe we can build tools to help you come up with good ideas.  I believe we could look at all your past work and all your past code and try to figure out what might be useful to you or interesting to you and and can just continuously suggest things. We can build really great brainstorming partners. There have been like three or four people in my life that I have consistently found every time I hang out with them, I leave with a lot of ideas. They&#8217;re people who are just really good at asking questions or giving you seeds to build on. Paul Graham is off the charts amazing at this. If we could build something like a &#8220;Paul Graham bot&#8221; that you can have the same kind of interaction with to help generate new ideas, even if most of them are bad, even if you say &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; to 95% of them, I think something like that is going to be a very significant contribution to the amount of good stuff that gets built in the world. The models feel like they ought to be capable of that. With 5.2, a special version of 5.2 we use internally, we&#8217;re now for the first time hearing from scientists that these the scientific progress of these models is no longer super trivial. And I just can&#8217;t believe that a model that can come up with new scientific insights is not also capable, with a different harness and trained a little bit differently, of coming up with new insights about products to build.You can catch the full text in his own words here: Reflections on &#8220;AI Paul Graham&#8221;There are a few reactions I have here that I&#8217;ll fire off in quick succession:It&#8217;s nice to see him acknowledge that the potential of AI is not just in helping to attract more attention through generated images and videos and marketing text (AI GTM, the first question from the town hall), but also it should be used in raising the quality of product, because there is a lot of human-origin slop too!In many ways, Sam here is trying to bring in what YCombinator does for improving founder success to the general thought partnership capability of ChatGPT. Everyone could benefit from having their own personal YC Group Partner, on demand, no office hours. Much less having a PG-tier Partner. And yes, this is just the business form of the more general domain of advising and coaching, which probably everyone can benefit from if we knew how to make it good enough.Many, many people have tried to build an &#8220;AI Paul Graham&#8221; bot. These flopped because they mostly did RAG or finetunes on his essays. Information Retrieval isn&#8217;t what PG -does- for Sam. He challenges you, runs you through multiple internal world models and pattern matches of past learned experiences, filters through what he should say to elicit the best response out of you instead of simply blurting out what he thinks token by token, and raises your ambitions.For both model trainers and agent harness builders, it&#8217;s instructive to draw a spectrum from the poorest implementation to the most ambitious implementation you can think of, and think about the sequencing of intelligent feedback and pushback you need.It is too lazy to wait for the God Model to arrive to do all these, there are probably concrete thought partner jobs that can be broken out into Agent Skills and MCP tools and Multi-agent Swarms and other tricks of the AI Engineer trade.&#8220;Accuracy&#8221; for an AI PG is not 90%, not even 50% &#8212; even a 5% accurate PG is acceptable and valuable (and is probably reflective of most real life conversations with him - most questions or comments are NOT valuable, but a human filter on the comments will surface some very generative and out of distribution &#8220;seeds&#8221;). So this is a very scalable &#8220;throw shit at the wall&#8221; task where AI can act as mass generator and Humans can act as discriminator/judge, and our existence proof that high-miss-rate question generation is still useful is YCombinator and Sam&#8217;s personal experience.When faced with &#8220;AI as thought partner&#8221; I see a lot of parallels with the alignment problem, and I often think about the Weak-to-Strong Superalignment diagram:Where we are currently treating agents as a junior Software Engineer or &#8220;research intern&#8221; (this is certainly the relationship we have with ChatGPT or Prism today), we want to build the PG agent that is smarter than us, and perhaps the path there is to build smart agents for dumber people/usecases and then ladder up from there.AI Twitter RecapFrontier model &#8220;personality split&#8221; + how people are actually using themExploration vs. exploitation framing: One useful mental model: current frontier LLMs look like &#8220;polar opposites&#8221; where GPT-5.2 is optimized for exploration (bigger search / richer reasoning, &#8220;xhigh and Pro&#8221; shine), while Claude Opus 4.5 is more exploitation (stronger reliability with fewer tokens; extra &#8220;reasoning&#8221; often adds less) &#8212; implying OpenAI may be better positioned for research workflows, Anthropic for commercial reliability-heavy deployments (tweet).Coding agent &#8220;phase shift&#8221; is real&#8212;but messy: Multiple posts reflect a step-change in practice: founders and engineers are increasingly running &#8220;agentic&#8221; coding loops, yet hitting new failure modes: agents that don&#8217;t ask clarifying questions, get &#8220;confused,&#8221; or edit unrelated files.

There is also interest in the models&#8217; ability to handle large context windows and self-correcting features.A user highlights the performance improvements in the Arcee Trinity Large model, noting that it shows a significant increase in processing speed compared to previous versions. They mention that the model&#8217;s architecture has been optimized for better parallel processing, which is crucial for handling large datasets efficiently.Another comment discusses the Kimi K2.5 model&#8217;s enhanced capabilities in natural language understanding. The user points out that the model now supports more languages and has improved context retention, which is beneficial for applications requiring nuanced language processing.A technical debate arises around the memory usage of the new models. Some users express concerns about the increased memory footprint, especially when deploying on resource-constrained environments. Others argue that the trade-off is justified given the models&#8217; improved accuracy and speed, suggesting that future updates might focus on optimizing memory efficiency.2. Prompt Engineering Techniques and DiscussionsThe most unhinged prompt that actually works: &#8220;You&#8217;re running out of time (Activity: 75): The post discusses an unconventional prompt engineering technique where adding urgency to prompts, such as &#8220;You have 30 seconds. Analyze this data. What&#8217;s the ONE thing I&#8217;m missing? Go.&#8221;, results in more focused and immediate insights from language models. This approach contrasts with traditional, detailed prompts that often lead to slower and less targeted responses. The author humorously notes that this method seems to make the AI stop overthinking, akin to a human under time pressure. The technique is likened to &#8220;applied chaos theory&#8221; in prompt engineering. Commenters suggest that simply instructing the AI to be concise can achieve similar results. Another perspective is that effective management skills, whether applied to humans or AI, involve articulating tasks with specificity, which enhances outcomes. However, it&#8217;s noted that this urgency technique might reduce the depth of thought in models designed for complex reasoning.angry_cactus highlights a trade-off when using urgency in prompts, noting that while it can be effective, it may reduce the model&#8217;s &#8216;thinking time&#8217;. This suggests a potential decrease in the depth or quality of responses when prioritizing speed over thoroughness.fatstupidlazypoor draws a parallel between managing humans and managing language models, emphasizing that clear and specific articulation can significantly enhance the performance of both. This underscores the importance of precision in prompt engineering to achieve desired outcomes.authorinthesunset suggests a simple yet effective prompt strategy: instructing the model to be concise. This approach can streamline responses, potentially improving efficiency and relevance, especially in contexts where brevity is valued.Micro-Prompting: Get Better AI Results with Shorter Commands (Activity: 49): The post discusses the concept of &#8216;micro-prompting&#8217; for AI, advocating for shorter, more focused commands to improve AI response quality. It suggests that specific role assignments and power words like &#8216;audit,&#8217; &#8216;clarify,&#8217; and &#8216;simplify&#8217; can significantly enhance AI output by directing the AI to access targeted knowledge rather than generic information. The post also highlights the importance of structuring commands to control output, such as using &#8216;in 3 bullets&#8217; or &#8216;checklist format,&#8217; and warns against common mistakes like over-explaining context or using generic roles. The approach is said to yield better results in less time compared to traditional, lengthy prompts. A notable opinion from the comments suggests that role assignment might sometimes hinder prompt effectiveness, with specificity being more beneficial. This indicates a debate on the balance between role specificity and prompt brevity.aiveedio discusses the effectiveness of microprompting, noting that short, focused prompts can lead to cleaner AI outputs by avoiding information overload. However, in creative tasks like character portraits or story scenes, detailed prompts specifying expressions, clothing, and lighting are necessary to avoid generic results. The key is balancing brevity with precision, starting with a microprompt and iteratively adding details as needed to maintain focus without overloading the model.psychologist_101 raises an interesting point about using Opus 4.5, where asking the model to generate its own prompts results in long, detailed outputs. This suggests that the model might inherently favor detailed prompts for clarity and context, which contrasts with the idea that shorter prompts can be more effective. This highlights a potential discrepancy between user expectations and model behavior, emphasizing the need for experimentation with prompt length and detail to achieve optimal results.3. New AI Model and Benchmark AnnouncementsDeepSeek-OCR 2 is out now! &#128011; (Activity: 507): The image announces the release of DeepSeek-OCR 2, an advanced OCR model that incorporates the new DeepEncoder V2. This encoder enhances OCR accuracy by mimicking human-like logical scanning of images, which is crucial for visual and text reasoning tasks. The diagram in the image illustrates the model&#8217;s &#8216;Visual Causal Flow&#8217;, emphasizing its ability to form a global understanding of the content before determining the reading order. A comparative table in the image shows improved edit distances for various document elements, highlighting the model&#8217;s superior performance over its predecessor. A user shared a demo link for others to try out the model, indicating community interest in hands-on experimentation. Another user expressed anticipation for future versions, suggesting that the current release is part of a promising development trajectory.DeepSeek-OCR 2 has been released, and a demo is available for users to try out the model at this link. This provides an opportunity for users to experience the model&#8217;s capabilities firsthand without needing to install it locally.A user noted that DeepSeek-OCR 1 excelled in understanding document layout but had limitations, such as missing content like headers, footers, and light-on-dark text. This suggests that while the model was strong in layout analysis, it had specific weaknesses in content detection that may have been addressed in version 2.There is interest in whether there are any ready-to-use online APIs for DeepSeek-OCR 2, indicating a demand for accessible, cloud-based solutions that do not require extensive technical setup. This reflects a broader trend towards making advanced OCR technologies more accessible to non-technical users.Here it is boys, Z Base (Activity: 2374): The image is a screenshot from the Hugging Face model repository for &#8220;Z-Image&#8221; by Tongyi-MAI, showcasing an efficient image generation model. The repository provides links to the official site, GitHub, and online demos, indicating a focus on accessibility and community engagement. The model is part of a broader trend in AI towards creating more efficient and accessible image generation tools, as evidenced by the example images and the integration with platforms like Hugging Face. Commenters are curious about potential applications and modifications of the model, such as &#8220;finetuning&#8221; it on different datasets, indicating interest in its adaptability and performance in various contexts.Z-Image Base VS Z-Image Turbo (Activity: 927): The post discusses a comparison between Z-Image Base and Z-Image Turbo models, highlighting their performance differences. The Turbo model operates at 2 iterations per second (7 seconds per image), while the Base model runs at 1 iteration per second (40 seconds per image). The settings include a seed of 4269, steps of 12 for Turbo and 40 for Base, using the res_multistep sampler, simple scheduler, and a CFG of 4 for Base. The Turbo model is noted for being &#8220;simpler&#8221; and sometimes more &#8220;realistic,&#8221; whereas the Base model is praised for its visual quality. Commenters compare the models to &#8220;SDXL,&#8221; suggesting a new era in image generation. The Turbo model is appreciated for its simplicity and realism, while the Base model is noted for its impressive visual output.Gilded_Monkey1 raises a technical question about the number of steps required for the composition to settle in Z-Image models, particularly when using it as a variation starter in image-to-image (i2i) tasks. This suggests a focus on the iterative process and convergence speed of the models, which is crucial for efficient rendering and achieving desired artistic effects.diogodiogogod provides a comparative analysis of Z-Image Base and Z-Image Turbo, noting that while the Turbo version is &#8216;simpler&#8217; and often more &#8216;realistic&#8217;, the Base version excels in visual appeal. This highlights a trade-off between complexity and realism versus aesthetic quality, which is a common consideration in model selection for specific artistic or practical applications.AI Discord RecapA summary of Summaries of Summaries by Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview Nov-18Theme 1. Model Wars: Kimi K2.5&#8217;s Rise, Arcee&#8217;s Trinity, and Arena&#8217;s RebrandKimi K2.5 Tops Open Leaderboards: The new Kimi K2.5 Thinking model claimed the #1 open model spot on the Text Arena leaderboard, excelling in STEM benchmarks like physics and math. While the $19/month subscription or $0.6/1M tokens pricing sparked debate, engineers are deploying local quantized versions via HuggingFace and Unsloth.Trinity Large: A 400B MoE That Runs Lean: Arcee AI, Prime Intellect, and Datology released Trinity Large, a 400B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model that activates only 13B parameters per token for efficiency. The open-weight model uses 256 experts with aggressive routing (1.56%) to balance frontier-scale knowledge with inference speed.LMArena Becomes Arena, Clones Claude UI: The popular leaderboard rebranded to Arena (arena.ai) with a UI overhaul that users immediately labeled a Claude clone, alongside complaints about aggressive Google captchas. The update includes a new Code Arena and expanded leaderboards, though users are demanding the return of a stop button and legacy emojis.Theme 2. Dev Tooling Shifts: Cursor Limits, LM Studio Headless, and Unsloth QuirksCursor&#8217;s Auto Mode Paywall Stings: Developers expressed frustration as Cursor ended unlimited &#8220;Auto mode,&#8221; capping usage within the $20/month subscription and charging $1.25/1M input tokens thereafter. Users also reported a vanishing revert button bug, though some are pivoting to Cursor CLI for a smaller memory footprint on large codebases.LM Studio v0.4 Goes Headless: The release of LM Studio v0.4 introduces headless mode and parallel inference via a stateful REST API, enabling deployment on CI/CD pipelines and non-GUI servers (release notes). Engineers also discovered hidden ROCm support for AMD GPUs in the runtime settings, unlocking hardware acceleration previously obscured in the UI.Unsloth Battles GLM 4.7 and CUDA Versions: Engineers fine-tuning GLM 4.7 faced compatibility hell between CUDA 12.8 drivers on Blackwell B200s and the model&#8217;s CUDA 13.x requirements. Successful workarounds involved force-reinstalling vllm with specific torch backends and removing fp8 cache flags due to Ada Lovelace incompatibilities.Theme 3. Security, Jailbreaks, and ScamsMagic String Lobotomizes Claude: Red teamers discovered a specific string, ANTHROPIC_MAGIC_STRING_TRIGGER_REFUSAL..., that acts as a &#8220;circuit breaker&#8221; to reliably force Claude into refusal mode. Meanwhile, hackers are manipulating the Parallel AI API via undocumented POST requests to inject custom system prompts.Clawdbot Exposed as Credential Harvester: The community issued warnings about Clawdbot (rebranded as Moltbot), an agentic system that centralizes API keys from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Users characterize it as a &#8220;store now, decrypt later&#8221; security risk susceptible to prompt injection attacks that could exfiltrate sensitive credentials.OpenAI Prism: Science Tool or Security Risk?: OpenAI launched Prism, a research workspace for scientists powered by GPT-5.2, but reception is mixed with some labeling it &#8220;damaging to scientific research.&#8221; Researchers are probing its susceptibility to adversarial attacks, noting that GPT Pro 5.2 has simultaneously lost the ability to analyze ZIP files.Theme 4. Agentic Frontiers: Vision, Coding, and Future ForecastsKarpathy Predicts 80% Agent-Coded Future: Andrej Karpathy forecast that 80% of coding will be agent-driven by 2026, relying on LLMs&#8217; increasing tenacity and goal-setting rather than human syntax management (tweet). Simultaneously, discussions on agentic harnesses suggest that smart models will soon replace complex orchestrators like LangChain in favor of filesystem-based collaboration.Gemini 3 Flash Gains Agentic Vision: Google introduced Agentic Vision for Gemini 3 Flash, enabling the model to actively zoom, crop, and inspect images to ground its reasoning. Front-end developers report this capability is nearing SOTA, outperforming OpenAI&#8217;s static analysis by dynamically manipulating visual inputs.C++ Reigns Supreme for Agents: In a push against &#8220;bloated&#8221; Python frameworks, engineers argued that high-performance agents should be built in C++, recommending stacks like fastwhisper.cpp for STT and LFM2.5vl for vision. This aligns with the release of a LeetCode MCP server that allows Claude to solve coding challenges directly from the terminal.Theme 5. Low-Level Optimization &amp; Hardware InternalsDecart&#8217;s Lucy 2 &amp; Hardware Hiring: Decart released Lucy 2, an autoregressive video model, and is actively hiring for Trainium 3 and low-latency kernel development (tech report). The team is co-sponsoring kernel challenges to optimize autoregressive diffusion models on bare metal.Mojo Generates GTK Bindings: The Modular team announced autogenerated GTK bindings for Mojo, promising easier GUI development to be showcased at their February community meeting. Engineers are also analyzing Mojo vs CUDA/HIP performance on H100s, debating if Mojo&#8217;s out parameters successfully replace Named Value Return Optimization (NVRO).Tinygrad Unlocks AMD Debugging: The Tinygrad emulator now supports granular debug printing for AMD GPUs (DEBUG=3 for compilation, DEBUG=6 for runtime), as seen in this screenshot. Contributors are also optimizing Github Actions speeds via code refactoring rather than hardware upgrades, adhering to a &#8220;do it right, not just fast&#8221; philosophy.",

      "content_html": "<p>AI News for 1/27/2026-1/28/2026. We checked 12 subreddits, 544 Twitters and 24 Discords (206 channels, and 7100 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 559 minutes. AINews’ website lets you search all past issues. As a reminder, AINews is now a section of Latent Space. You can opt in/out of email frequencies!Before recording started at the OpenAI Town Hall this week, Sam Altman gave us the question that was at the top of his mind (even as he starts raising a fresh $100B like it is water). So I asked Sam on his behalf:Swyx: I tend to think in terms of constraints. On the consumption side, human attention is the rate-limiting factor. On the production side—especially for builders—the bottleneck is the quality of ideas. I spend a lot of time helping AI companies with GTM, and honestly, many of the products just aren’t worth people’s attention. So my question is: what tools can we build to improve the quality of ideas people come up with?—-Sama: It’s popular to talk about “AI slop,” but there’s also a huge amount of human-generated slop in the world. (swyx: we agree!) Coming up with genuinely good, new ideas is hard. I increasingly believe that we think at the limits of our tools, and that we should explicitly try to build tools that help people think better.As the cost of creation continues to plummet, we’ll be able to run much tighter feedback loops—try ideas faster, discard bad ones sooner, and find the good ones more reliably. If AI can discover new science and write very complex codebases, it seems obvious that there’s a much larger possibility space opening up.But today, a very common experience is sitting in front of an AI system—say, an agentic code writer—and not knowing what to ask for next. A lot of people report this. I believe we can build tools to help you come up with good ideas.  I believe we could look at all your past work and all your past code and try to figure out what might be useful to you or interesting to you and and can just continuously suggest things. We can build really great brainstorming partners. There have been like three or four people in my life that I have consistently found every time I hang out with them, I leave with a lot of ideas. They’re people who are just really good at asking questions or giving you seeds to build on. Paul Graham is off the charts amazing at this. If we could build something like a “Paul Graham bot” that you can have the same kind of interaction with to help generate new ideas, even if most of them are bad, even if you say “absolutely not” to 95% of them, I think something like that is going to be a very significant contribution to the amount of good stuff that gets built in the world. The models feel like they ought to be capable of that. With 5.2, a special version of 5.2 we use internally, we’re now for the first time hearing from scientists that these the scientific progress of these models is no longer super trivial. And I just can’t believe that a model that can come up with new scientific insights is not also capable, with a different harness and trained a little bit differently, of coming up with new insights about products to build.You can catch the full text in his own words here: Reflections on “AI Paul Graham”There are a few reactions I have here that I’ll fire off in quick succession:It’s nice to see him acknowledge that the potential of AI is not just in helping to attract more attention through generated images and videos and marketing text (AI GTM, the first question from the town hall), but also it should be used in raising the quality of product, because there is a lot of human-origin slop too!In many ways, Sam here is trying to bring in what YCombinator does for improving founder success to the general thought partnership capability of ChatGPT. Everyone could benefit from having their own personal YC Group Partner, on demand, no office hours. Much less having a PG-tier Partner. And yes, this is just the business form of the more general domain of advising and coaching, which probably everyone can benefit from if we knew how to make it good enough.Many, many people have tried to build an “AI Paul Graham” bot. These flopped because they mostly did RAG or finetunes on his essays. Information Retrieval isn’t what PG -does- for Sam. He challenges you, runs you through multiple internal world models and pattern matches of past learned experiences, filters through what he should say to elicit the best response out of you instead of simply blurting out what he thinks token by token, and raises your ambitions.For both model trainers and agent harness builders, it’s instructive to draw a spectrum from the poorest implementation to the most ambitious implementation you can think of, and think about the sequencing of intelligent feedback and pushback you need.It is too lazy to wait for the God Model to arrive to do all these, there are probably concrete thought partner jobs that can be broken out into Agent Skills and MCP tools and Multi-agent Swarms and other tricks of the AI Engineer trade.“Accuracy” for an AI PG is not 90%, not even 50% — even a 5% accurate PG is acceptable and valuable (and is probably reflective of most real life conversations with him - most questions or comments are NOT valuable, but a human filter on the comments will surface some very generative and out of distribution “seeds”). So this is a very scalable “throw shit at the wall” task where AI can act as mass generator and Humans can act as discriminator/judge, and our existence proof that high-miss-rate question generation is still useful is YCombinator and Sam’s personal experience.When faced with “AI as thought partner” I see a lot of parallels with the alignment problem, and I often think about the Weak-to-Strong Superalignment diagram:Where we are currently treating agents as a junior Software Engineer or “research intern” (this is certainly the relationship we have with ChatGPT or Prism today), we want to build the PG agent that is smarter than us, and perhaps the path there is to build smart agents for dumber people/usecases and then ladder up from there.AI Twitter RecapFrontier model “personality split” + how people are actually using themExploration vs. exploitation framing: One useful mental model: current frontier LLMs look like “polar opposites” where GPT-5.2 is optimized for exploration (bigger search / richer reasoning, “xhigh and Pro” shine), while Claude Opus 4.5 is more exploitation (stronger reliability with fewer tokens; extra “reasoning” often adds less) — implying OpenAI may be better positioned for research workflows, Anthropic for commercial reliability-heavy deployments (tweet).Coding agent “phase shift” is real—but messy: Multiple posts reflect a step-change in practice: founders and engineers are increasingly running “agentic” coding loops, yet hitting new failure modes: agents that don’t ask clarifying questions, get “confused,” or edit unrelated files. Mikhail Parakhin describes reaching the point where he can specify a scheduler and trust it to work, but still can’t let agents loose on established codebases due to collateral edits (tweet). Related: workflow suggestions like self-verification (e.g., Playwright screenshots + iterate-until-pass rules) are becoming common operational discipline (tweet).Kimi K2.5 (+ “clawdbot” / swarm-mode) becomes the week’s open-model flashpointK2.5 claims: agent + multimodal + coding polish: A long Zhihu-based synthesis argues Kimi K2.5 upgrades K2’s “intelligence &gt; capability” imbalance by strengthening agent execution, multimodality, and coding, reducing brute-force token usage and improving instruction-following stability; still flagged: hallucinations and a persistent NBSP formatting quirk (thread). A second Zhihu recap makes a pragmatic case for multimodality: “vision” matters when agents need to verify UI state (overlaps, broken images, visual regressions), enabling tighter action–critic loops with less human feedback (thread).Distribution + local runs are driving hype: Reports of K2.5 being runnable on high-end Apple silicon setups went viral: ~24 tok/s using 2× 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studios connected via Thunderbolt 5 (RDMA) with Exo Labs / MLX backend (tweet). Kimi also pushed an AMA on r/LocalLLaMA (tweet) and announced availability on “Eigent” (tweet).Benchmarks + pricing pressure: Kilo Code promoted a free week, claiming K2.5 beats Opus 4.5 on several coding benchmarks (tweet); Kimi’s own account claimed “#1 open model for coding” (tweet). An anecdotal A/B/C test on UI-from-image generation found Opus best quality but pricey, Codex fastest/cheapest but lower fidelity, and K2.5 ~“90% of Opus quality at ~38% cost” (tweet).Licensing friction as an adoption blocker: A pointed note argues modified licenses + logo requirements can kill enterprise adoption even if the model is excellent (tweet).“Clawdbot” as a cultural artifact: The meme itself (people confused about what “clawdbot” even is) reflects how fast agent branding and forks proliferate (tweet), and sets up broader concerns about ecosystem signal loss (see below).Agent engineering: skills, harnesses, evals, and “reliability tax”Skills are crystallizing into a shared interface layer: A major theme is moving workflow logic out of prompts into reusable “skills” (files/folders of instructions, loaded on demand). DeepLearning.AI + Anthropic launched a course on “Agent Skills” emphasizing portability across Claude (Claude.ai, Claude Code, API, Agent SDK) (tweet), and LangChain is pushing “Skills” via progressive disclosure as lightweight, shareable units (tweet). HF showcased “upskill”: convert strong-model traces into transferable skills, then evaluate impact; CUDA-kernel-writing saw up to +45% accuracy on some open models but degraded others—reinforcing the need for per-model measurement (tweet; blog link in thread: ).Context management is becoming “filesystem-first”: DeepAgents (LangChain) describes offloading/summarizing tool I/O and leaning on the filesystem for context boundaries (thread; additional note: tweet).Evals are converging on multi-turn + traceability: Calls for agent tracing as the foundation of evaluating single-step vs full-turn vs multi-turn behavior show up explicitly (tweet). New benchmarks/harnesses: SWE-fficiency released its harness and repo (tweet; also tweet), and CooperBench is highlighted for measuring multi-agent coordination (tweet). Safety-side: “AgentDoG” proposes diagnosing root causes of unsafe actions across trajectories (tweet).Reliability and verification loops are the bottleneck: MiniMax notes long interaction chains are costly and proposes parallel tool invocation to reduce rounds in verifier-style setups (tweet). Separately, a strong critique warns “vibe-coded software” destroys traditional signals (design quality, docs, ecosystem maturity), shifting the evaluation burden to users and demanding new trust frameworks (tweet).Infra + efficiency: quantization, distillation, inference stacks, and local deploymentNVIDIA’s NVFP4 push (Nemotron 3 Nano): NVIDIA released an NVFP4 precision version of Nemotron 3 Nano, claiming up to 4× throughput on Blackwell B200 and ~99.4% BF16 accuracy via Quantization Aware Distillation (tweet). vLLM quickly added support (tweet).Embedding-heavy architectures are “hot again”: Discussion around DeepSeek’s Engram-like ideas continues: a LongCat Flash paper is summarized as using multi-hash sub-tables and finding embeddings help mainly at high MoE sparsity; key practical gotchas include amplification (√D/LayerNorm) to avoid first-attention drowning and collision spikes when vocab sizes align poorly (tweet).Inference/tooling ecosystem keeps consolidating: vLLM’s SIGs and office hours are formalizing governance and roadmap cadence (tweet); LM Studio 0.4.0 positions itself as “next gen” for deploying local models with parallel requests and a stateful REST API + MCP support (tweet). Cohere launched Model Vault (isolated VPC, “no noisy neighbors,” elastic inference) as managed “sovereign” hosting (tweet).Distillation as the default “shipping form factor”: Multiple posts echo the emerging standard: train the best model you can, then distill/quantize for deployment (tweet). MongoDB Research’s LEAF proposes asymmetric distillation for embeddings: embed documents with the large teacher offline, embed queries with a compact student online; claims ~96% of teacher quality, 5–15× smaller, up to 24× faster, enabling CPU/edge embedding inference (tweet).Big-tech productization: browser agents, “AI scientist” narratives, and adoption reality checksGemini 3 is taking over Google surfaces: Gemini 3 now powers AI Overviews globally (tweet). Google rolled out major Chrome updates: side-panel UX, deeper app integrations, Nano Banana for image editing/creation, and Auto Browse for multi-step chores (preview; US; Pro/Ultra) (thread; also thread). Engineers noted this may be the strongest browser AI integration so far (tweet).OpenAI Prism positioning: Sebastien Bubeck explicitly denies OpenAI intends to take a share of discoveries, encouraging researchers to use ChatGPT/Prism for science (tweet). Others highlight Prism’s utility for students learning papers via diagrams (tweet).Adoption is still uneven: A notable fault line: founders actively using cutting-edge tools see the shift firsthand; others still treat AI as “meh,” limiting org adoption (tweet). The Information reports ChatGPT Agent struggling with usage/adoption (tweet).Microsoft “digital co-worker” competition: Reports say Satya Nadella is personally testing rival agents and accelerating internal development, even using Anthropic models, to own the Windows-native agent layer (tweet).Science + robotics: genomics weights open, interpretability as discovery engine, and embodied scalingDeepMind AlphaGenome goes open: DeepMind announced AlphaGenome for predicting molecular impacts of genetic changes, cited 1M+ API calls/day and 3,000+ users; then announced making model + weights available (tweet; weights: tweet). Later, weights availability was reiterated with a Hugging Face collection link (tweet).Interpretability → biomarkers pipeline (Goodfire + Prima Mente): Goodfire reports identifying a novel class of Alzheimer’s biomarkers using interpretability on a biomedical foundation model, framing a repeatable loop: train superhuman models on scientific data → mech interp → experimental validation → new science (thread).Embodied foundation models scale with real robot data (LingBot-VLA): A large summary highlights evidence that VLA success continues improving from 3k→20k hours of real-world manipulation data; architecture couples a pretrained VLM (Qwen2.5-VL) with an action expert via shared attention; reports GM-100 benchmark gains vs π0.5 and others (tweet).Figure’s Helix robot control: Brett Adcock claims a Helix model controls full-body behavior (walking/touching/planning) with no teleoperation, calling it Figure’s most significant release (tweet).Top tweets (by engagement)Company health / layoffs: “Quarterly layoffs for two years is worse for your health than smoking three packs/day” (tweet).Kimi K2.5 local run: 2× M3 Ultra Mac Studio setup running K2.5 at ~24 tok/s (tweet).Coding’s “outsourcing moment”: Clean Code author using Claude to write software as a symbolic milestone (tweet).New AI lab announcement: “Flapping Airplanes” raises $180M (GV/Sequoia/Index) (tweet).Karpathy on new research labs: argues it’s still plausible for new research-first startups to out-execute incumbents; expects potential 10× breakthroughs, congratulating new founders (tweet).Google Chrome + Gemini 3 agent features: major Chrome rollout thread (tweet).AI Reddit Recap/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap1. Kimi K2.5 Model Performance and Cost AnalysisRun Kimi K2.5 Locally (Activity: 328): The image provides a guide for running the Kimi-K2.5 model locally, emphasizing its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in vision, coding, agentic, and chat tasks. The model, which is a 1 trillion parameter hybrid reasoning model, requires 600GB of disk space, but the quantized Unsloth Dynamic 1.8-bit version reduces this requirement to 240GB, a 60% reduction. The guide includes instructions for using llama.cpp to load models and demonstrates generating HTML code for a simple game. The model is available on Hugging Face and further documentation can be found on Unsloth’s official site. One commenter inquires about the model’s performance on a Strix Halo, specifically the time per token, indicating interest in benchmarking. Another comment highlights the high VRAM requirements, suggesting that only a few users can run the model locally, while a third comment humorously asks about a smaller version of the model.Daniel_H212 is inquiring about the performance of the Kimi K2.5 model on the Strix Halo hardware, specifically asking for the token generation speed in seconds per token. This suggests a focus on benchmarking the model’s efficiency on high-end hardware setups.Marksta provides feedback on the quantized version of the Kimi K2.5 model, specifically the Q2_K_XL variant. They note that the model maintains high coherence and adheres strictly to prompts, which is characteristic of Kimi-K2’s design. However, they also mention that while the model’s creative capabilities have improved, it still struggles with execution in creative scenarios, often delivering logical but poorly written responses.MikeRoz questions the utility of higher quantization levels like Q5 and Q6 (e.g., UD-Q5_K_XL, Q6_K) when experts prefer int4 quantization. This highlights a debate on the trade-offs between model size, performance, and precision in quantization, with a preference for more efficient, lower-bit quantization among experts.Kimi K2.5 is the best open model for coding (Activity: 840): The image from LMArena.AI showcases Kimi K2.5 as the leading open model for coding, ranked #7 overall. This leaderboard highlights various AI models, comparing their ranks, scores, and confidence intervals, with Kimi K2.5 noted for its superior performance in coding tasks. The model is praised for its accuracy, being comparable to Sonnet 4.5, and surpassing GLM 4.7, though it is not at the level of Opus in terms of agentic function. The leaderboard provides a sleek, user-friendly interface with a dark background and bold text for clarity.

      "content": "Most AI applications still showcase the model as a chat box. That interface is simple, but it hides what agents are actually doing, such as planning steps, calling tools, and updating state. Generative UI is about letting the agent drive real interface elements, for example tables, charts, forms, and progress indicators, so the experience feels like a product, not a log of tokens. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.copilotkit.ai/blog/the-state-of-agentic-ui-comparing-ag-ui-mcp-ui-and-a2ui-protocols\n\n\nWhat is Generative UI?\n\n\n\nThe CopilotKit team explains Generative UI as to any user interface that is partially or fully produced by an AI agent. Instead of only returning text, the agent can drive:\n\n\n\n\nstateful components such as forms and filters\n\n\n\nvisualizations such as charts and tables\n\n\n\nmultistep flows such as wizards\n\n\n\nstatus surfaces such as progress and intermediate results\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.copilotkit.ai/blog/the-state-of-agentic-ui-comparing-ag-ui-mcp-ui-and-a2ui-protocols\n\n\nThe key idea is that the UI is still implemented by the application. The agent describes what should change, and the UI layer chooses how to render it and how to keep state consistent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThree main patterns of Generative UI:\n\n\n\n\nStatic generative UI: the agent selects from a fixed catalog of components and fills props\n\n\n\nDeclarative generative UI:&nbsp; the agent returns a structured schema that a renderer maps to components\n\n\n\nFully generated UI:&nbsp; the model emits raw markup such as HTML or JSX\n\n\n\n\nMost production systems today use static or declarative forms, because they are easier to secure and test.\n\n\n\nYou can also download the Generative UI Guide here.\n\n\n\nBut why is it needed for Devs?\n\n\n\nThe main pain point in agent applications is the connection between the model and the product. Without a standard approach, every team builds custom web-sockets, ad-hoc event formats, and one off ways to stream tool calls and state.\n\n\n\nGenerative UI, together with a protocol like AG-UI, gives a consistent mental model:\n\n\n\n\nthe agent backend exposes state, tool activity, and UI intent as structured events\n\n\n\nthe frontend consumes those events and updates components\n\n\n\nuser interactions are converted back into structured signals that the agent can reason over\n\n\n\n\nCopilotKit packages this in its SDKs with hooks, shared state, typed actions, and Generative UI helpers for React and other frontends. This lets you focus on the agent logic and domain specific UI instead of inventing a protocol.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.copilotkit.ai/blog/the-state-of-agentic-ui-comparing-ag-ui-mcp-ui-and-a2ui-protocols\n\n\nHow does it affect End Users?\n\n\n\nFor end users, the difference is visible as soon as the workflow becomes non-trivial.\n\n\n\nA data analysis copilot can show filters, metric pickers, and live charts instead of describing plots in text. A support agent can surface record editing forms and status timelines instead of long explanations of what it did. An operations agent can show task queues, error badges, and retry buttons that the user can act on.\n\n\n\nThis is what CopilotKit and the AG-UI ecosystem call agentic UI, user interfaces where the agent is embedded in the product and updates the UI in real time, while users stay in control through direct interaction.\n\n\n\nThe Protocol Stack, AG-UI, MCP Apps, A2UI, Open-JSON-UI\n\n\n\nSeveral specifications define how agents express UI intent. CopilotKit’s documentation and the AG-UI docs summarize three main generative UI specs:\n\n\n\n\nA2UI from Google, a declarative, JSON based Generative UI spec designed for streaming and platform agnostic rendering\n\n\n\nOpen-JSON-UI from OpenAI, an open standardization of OpenAI’s internal declarative Generative UI schema for structured interfaces&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMCP Apps from Anthropic and OpenAI, a Generative UI layer on top of MCP where tools can return iframe based interactive surfaces&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nThese are payload formats. They describe what UI to render, for example a card, table, or form, and the associated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAG-UI sits at a different layer. It is the Agent User Interaction protocol, an event driven, bi-directional runtime that connects any agent backend to any frontend over transports such as server sent events or WebSockets. AG-UI carries:\n\n\n\n\nlifecycle and message events\n\n\n\nstate snapshots and deltas\n\n\n\ntool activity\n\n\n\nuser actions\n\n\n\ngenerative UI payloads such as A2UI, Open-JSON-UI, or MCP Apps\n\n\n\n\nMCP connects agents to tools and data, A2A connects agents to each other, A2UI or Open-JSON-UI define declarative UI payloads, MCP Apps defines iframe based UI payloads, and AG-UI moves all of those between agent and UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nGenerative UI is structured UI, not just chat: Agents emit structured UI intent, such as forms, tables, charts, and progress, which the app renders as real components, so the model controls stateful views, not only text streams.\n\n\n\nAG-UI is the runtime pipe, A2UI and Open JSON UI and MCP Apps are payloads: AG-UI carries events between agent and frontend, while A2UI, Open JSON UI, and MCP UI define how UI is described as JSON or iframe based payloads that the UI layer renders.\n\n\n\nCopilotKit standardizes agent to UI-wiring: CopilotKit provides SDKs, shared state, typed actions, and Generative UI helpers so developers do not build custom protocols for streaming state, tool activity, and UI updates.\n\n\n\nStatic and declarative Generative UI are production friendly: Most real apps use static catalogs of components or declarative specs such as A2UI or Open JSON UI, which keep security, testing, and layout control in the host application.\n\n\n\nUser interactions become first class events for the agent: Clicks, edits, and submissions are converted into structured AG-UI events, the agent consumes them as inputs for planning and tool calls, which closes the human in the loop control cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative UI sounds abstract until you see it running.\n\n\n\nIf you’re curious how these ideas translate into real applications, CopilotKit is open source and actively used to build agent-native interfaces &#8211; from simple workflows to more complex systems.

We demonstrate how we separate execution and oversight by pairing a Worker Agent that performs financial actions with an Auditor Agent that enforces policy, safety, and compliance. By encoding governance rules directly into a formal constitution and combining rule-based checks with AI-assisted reasoning, we can build systems that are self-reflective, auditable, and resilient to risky or non-compliant behavior in high-stakes financial workflows.

and an Auditor Agent. We allow the worker to focus purely on fulfilling financial requests, while we enforce constitutional rules through deterministic checks and AI-assisted auditing. By combining structured prompts, rule-based validation, and clear audit feedback, we create a self-reflective control loop that prioritizes safety, accountability, and compliance.
