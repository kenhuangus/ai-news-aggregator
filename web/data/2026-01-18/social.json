The truth is, it's going to be hard for the typical American family to afford one of these robots in their homes. However, if you could rent one to do your laundry, it would be much more affordable. A $100,000 robot could be rented to you for around $20 an hour, while the wholesale cost of operation would only be about $4 or $5 an hour.\n\nMaintenance issues (such as broken hands, worn-out batteries, or actuators that need replacing) would be covered by the rental fee. This model also allows the government or Tesla to adjust prices based on regulation. Eventually, we may see robots regulated to help pay for everyone's housing and food. If you sell the robots outright, it's difficult to recoup costs from new regulations, but if you rent them, you can simply increase the price to cover those costs as they arise.\n\nA rental model offers several advantages:\n1. Resource Sharing: A single robot could be shared among neighbors or different businesses. A company might only need a robot for eight hours a day to perform a specific job; after that, it could be returned to the network to work as a security guard overnight.\n2. Maximized Utility: This ensures each individual robot is used to its full potential, preventing wealthy individuals from buying them up just to let them sit idle in a garage or only use them for parties.\n3. Continual Revenue: This would provide Tesla with a steady revenue stream, which investors prefer.\n\nTesla seems to be signaling this shift already by moving away from selling Full Self-Driving (FSD) outright. Starting in February, they are reportedly only renting the software for $100 a month. We are heading into a world where everything is rented based on your immediate needs, and I wouldn't be shocked if this is the path Elon Musk takes going forward.\n\nThe big question for the CyberCab is:\n(a) Does Elon want customers to fund the financing of the Robotaxi network so he doesn't have to put up as much money upfront?\n(b) Or does he want to own all the revenues from the network himself?\n\nI can see why he would want all of it.

      "content": "@arian_ghashghai I've been visiting robot companies in San Francisco and I agree with you: it is a very tough business to make happen in the short term and even the long term. Tesla has so many advantages that it will be interesting to see who actually survives until world models are ready to power a generalized humanoid robot.\n\nWhen I talk to people around the industry, almost everyone says that a generalized humanoid robot that is safe for homes is about five years away. Personally, I think it might be closer to three. I already bought a 1X Tech Neo robot for $20,000 that is coming this year, but that is hardly a generalized, all-AI robot yet. There is still a human embodied in the robot (teleoperation), and it will take a couple of years for them to finish the automation, partly through the training they get from early customers.\n\nThat said, there are a variety of different robotics companies taking different approaches and targeting different markets. It will be interesting to see which ones can get good enough to handle:\n1. Factory work\n2. Back-of-restaurant work\n\nGetting into the home is a much tougher prospect. We have already seen a lot of robot companies come and go. Companies like Willow Garage, Giant Robot Company, and K-Scale are already gone; it is already an extinction event for them.\n\nThe next few years are going to be interesting. I have a list of everyone in robotics here on X if you want to follow that, and I am watching it very closely because I am highly interested in the field. I see a huge total addressable market with people who have mobility issues (there are about 60 million people in that situation) who could dramatically reduce their suffering if they had a robot.\n\nThe game is just starting. Internally, things have been cooking for a while, but nobody has a robot in their house yet, except for maybe Elon Musk—and even he doesn't really talk about these robots at home. Thanks!",

It allows users to create, explore, and share dashboards with data from various sources like databases, cloud services, and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch). Grafana is widely used for visualizing time-series data, such as server metrics, application performance, or IoT sensor data, through customizable charts, graphs, and alerts. It supports plugins for extensibility and is popular in DevOps and IT for real-time system monitoring and analytics.</p>"
