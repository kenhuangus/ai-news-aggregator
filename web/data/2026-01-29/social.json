      "content": "@EricNewcomer I so enjoy how Tony @tfadell thinks because it matches a lot of my own thinking. First of all, I'm jealous you got this interview, but you did an extraordinary job. You asked all the questions I had in my head. \n\nI've been doing a lot of experiments with technology in the home. I have a couple of Teslas, a Span panel that runs the electricity going into my house, and a June oven with an NVIDIA card that automatically cooks my toast and other things I put in it. I also have a Pasha robot that helps cook and a Matic robot that cleans the floors (a vacuuming and mopping robot). I have Nanoleaf lights on a few of my walls, Philips Hue lights on others, a Sonos system for sound, and Amazon Ring doorbells on my doors.\n\nI'm hardly the ultimate user of this technology, partly because I live in a small, 1,600-square-foot house. For me to get from my couch to my thermostat is literally 15 steps, so it's not a big deal to go and adjust it. However, in a 40,000-square-foot house, the problem becomes much different; getting from a bedroom to the thermostat might be 300 steps. If you're a billionaire thinking about your time value of money and distraction, I can sell a very different kind of device to you than I could to myself or my friends and family.\n\nMost of my friends and family have almost none of this stuff. The average person doesn't think about a smart house, and it's hard to get them to care about it or afford the gadgets. It gets expensive just to have the devices that make a smart house possible:\n1. $20,000 audio-video system\n2. $7,500 Span panel\n3. $800 June oven\n4. $1,500 Pasha robot\n5. $1,200 Matic robot\n6. A few hundred dollars for Ring cameras\n\nThat’s not going to happen for most people quickly. Over the next ten years, as people get more devices, they might become open to having an AI run their house, but there are smaller, more useful things available now. I just posted a video about Nori (N-O-R-I), which is a small AI on your phone that helps manage your family tasks and calendars, like tracking soccer practice. There's also Wabi (W-A-B-I), which lets you build micro-apps to automate things or make fun games for the family. While these make the phone more useful, they also make it more addictive.\n\nIt’s hard to see how we’re going to get a humanoid robot into people’s homes. If I had a couple of hours with Tony, I’d spend that time thinking through:\n1. How a humanoid robot gets introduced to homes\n2. How to reach a cost level that everyday families can afford\n\nA monthly cost of $500—like the Neo robot from 1X—is a lot of money for most people. The only way it comes down is through a rental scheme where a robot spends a few hours at my house and then goes down the street to someone else's. If we're sharing a robot, the cost could drop to $250 a month. It would be interesting to hear how Tony would design such a system to make it safe for people.\n\nIf he were the CEO of Apple, I think he would spend a lot of time thinking about how to get people in the Apple ecosystem to want a robot in their home. Maybe Apple buys Matic, and that’s how the first Apple robot gets into the home. That would be brilliant.\n\nGreat interview! I'm jealous that you got to speak with one of the best product thinkers in the world. You asked great questions.",

      "content_html": "<p>@EricNewcomer I so enjoy how Tony @tfadell thinks because it matches a lot of my own thinking. First of all, I'm jealous you got this interview, but you did an extraordinary job. You asked all the questions I had in my head.</p>\n<p>I've been doing a lot of experiments with technology in the home. I have a couple of Teslas, a Span panel that runs the electricity going into my house, and a June oven with an NVIDIA card that automatically cooks my toast and other things I put in it. I also have a Pasha robot that helps cook and a Matic robot that cleans the floors (a vacuuming and mopping robot). I have Nanoleaf lights on a few of my walls, Philips Hue lights on others, a Sonos system for sound, and Amazon Ring doorbells on my doors.</p>\n<p>I'm hardly the ultimate user of this technology, partly because I live in a small, 1,600-square-foot house. For me to get from my couch to my thermostat is literally 15 steps, so it's not a big deal to go and adjust it. However, in a 40,000-square-foot house, the problem becomes much different; getting from a bedroom to the thermostat might be 300 steps. If you're a billionaire thinking about your time value of money and distraction, I can sell a very different kind of device to you than I could to myself or my friends and family.</p>\n<p>Most of my friends and family have almost none of this stuff. The average person doesn't think about a smart house, and it's hard to get them to care about it or afford the gadgets. It gets expensive just to have the devices that make a smart house possible:</p>\n<p>1. $20,000 audio-video system</p>\n<p>2. $7,500 Span panel</p>\n<p>3. $800 June oven</p>\n<p>4. $1,500 Pasha robot</p>\n<p>5. $1,200 Matic robot</p>\n<p>6. A few hundred dollars for Ring cameras</p>\n<p>That’s not going to happen for most people quickly. Over the next ten years, as people get more devices, they might become open to having an AI run their house, but there are smaller, more useful things available now. I just posted a video about Nori (N-O-R-I), which is a small AI on your phone that helps manage your family tasks and calendars, like tracking soccer practice. There's also Wabi (W-A-B-I), which lets you build micro-apps to automate things or make fun games for the family. While these make the phone more useful, they also make it more addictive.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to see how we’re going to get a humanoid robot into people’s homes. If I had a couple of hours with Tony, I’d spend that time thinking through:</p>\n<p>1. How a humanoid robot gets introduced to homes</p>\n<p>2. How to reach a cost level that everyday families can afford</p>\n<p>A monthly cost of $500—like the Neo robot from 1X—is a lot of money for most people. The only way it comes down is through a rental scheme where a robot spends a few hours at my house and then goes down the street to someone else's. If we're sharing a robot, the cost could drop to $250 a month. It would be interesting to hear how Tony would design such a system to make it safe for people.</p>\n<p>If he were the CEO of Apple, I think he would spend a lot of time thinking about how to get people in the Apple ecosystem to want a robot in their home. Maybe Apple buys Matic, and that’s how the first Apple robot gets into the home. That would be brilliant.</p>\n<p>Great interview! I'm jealous that you got to speak with one of the best product thinkers in the world. You asked great questions.</p>"

Nori is it. @Nori_FamilyAI \n\nBeen using this the past few days with my family, both on Web and on our mobile phones. It has a calendar, but an AI built in, that you can ask it to do things like “add doctors visit on Tuesday at 10 a.m.” or “book a table for us on Friday night at our favorite pizza place.” \n\nIt builds an attractive calendar, but more, and lets you plan all sorts of things for the family from recipes you’d like to try, or shopping lists, and more. Very useful when planning out trips to Costco, holiday planning, and covering all those doctor and dentists, along with all the other things that go into running a family with two teenagers.\n\nIt can remember all sorts of things, including wifi passwords, and can be setup to call everyone to remind them of an important event. Very handy to let teenagers know that a meeting with their teacher is about to happen. You can even have it call and remind them of chores, like they need to do their laundry. Oh, and the notifications are awesome too.\n\nThis is better than trying to do the same via Google Calendar and texts back and forth.

      "content": "#PaperADay 12\n2019: Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels (PlaNet)\nhttps://t.co/BYK9pysMxu\n\nThis was the forerunner to the Dreamer 1/2/3/4 series of RL agents / papers, which I am going to read in sequence.\n\nPlanning is common in tasks with fully specified transition and reward dynamics like board games, but it is much more challenging when you have to learn the “rules of the game” at the same time you are trying to improve your performance, especially when trying to do it from raw pixels instead of perfectly observed state features.\n\nI sometimes semi-jokingly defend the position that “planning” might not actually be a thing, at least at low levels like this, and it just feels like planning when relevant experiences are called up from memory and bootstrap training on them results in changes to the current policy decision. There is a classic Atari paper that makes the case that replay buffers *are* a sort of non-parametric world model.\n\nThis paper gets peak performance “close to” strong model-free algorithms, but with far less real world experience necessary, because most of the work is happening in planning. Often, model based methods have to struggle to get to parity with the simpler model-free algorithms, and that is still going on with the Atari100k benchmark today.\n\nThis is a classic model-based system with a state transition and reward model. The biggest problem with transition models is usually that errors accumulate rapidly, so you can’t predict many steps into the future.\n\nThe transition models take a state plus an action, and predict the next state and the reward that results from taking the action. One of the key findings of the paper was that trying to learn a deterministic transition model basically failed. A stochastic model could be trained, but performance improved when they combined both deterministic and stochastic calculations in the model.\n\nLooking closely at the video prediction frames in appendix H is interesting: once the deterministic GRU transition model lost the plot on a frame, everything after stayed broken, while the stochastic model could transition into something nonsensical on one frame, but then back to something sensible afterwards. I would not have guessed that. Their full combined model gave good looking predictions throughout.\n\nThere is no policy or value network as in model-free RL. Actions are selected by trying out a sequence of them using the modeled transition and reward functions, and the action that led to the best results is taken. Thousands of action sequences are evaluated for each action selected, but because they operate on compact latent vectors, this is relatively efficient. The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is used for planning multiple steps ahead with the transition models. This has to be heuristic for continuous action spaces or any more than a few modeled steps into the future.\n\nThe input to the state network is a 64x64 RGB observation (quantized to 5 bits like GLOW; I’m not clear why this is necessary). During training, they have an observation model that tries to go backwards from a state to a pixel observation. This is generally impossible to do perfectly when the state is smaller than the image, but attempting it provides a rich feedback signal for what to put in the state. This is not used for any part of the action decision process, it is just a training aid.\n\nAction-repeat of 2 to 8, depending on the task.\n\nLatent overshooting as a regularizer in latent space that encourages iterated one-step and multi-step predictions to match.",
