      "content": "AI News for 1/26/2026-1/27/2026. We checked 12 subreddits, 544 Twitters and 24 Discords (206 channels, and 7476 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 602 minutes. AINews&#8217; website lets you search all past issues. As a reminder, AINews is now a section of Latent Space. You can opt in/out of email frequencies!Kimi has been on an absolute tear in the past year, and we last heard from them in November with Kimi K2 Thinking. Like K2, today&#8217;s K2.5 is still a 32B active-1T param model (384 experts), &#8220;built through continual pretraining on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens atop Kimi-K2-Base&#8221; (which itself was on 15T tokens), and with an EXTREMELY well produced video from their founder (3 minutes, just watch it):They again claim SOTA on HLE and BrowseComp (footnotes give confidence the tests are legit), but also open model SOTA for vision and coding tasks:tweetThere are a few notables here - Kimi K2.5 is &#8220;natively multimodal&#8221; for the first time, perhaps borrowing from Kimi VL, but is attributed to &#8220;massive-scale vision-text joint pre-training&#8221; including VIDEO understanding - &#8220;simply upload a screen recording&#8221; and K2.5 can reconstruct the website for you:The fact that this is a continued pretrain that changes arch (+400M param MoonViT vision encoder) is VERY exciting for model training folks who rarely get to see a scaled up model do stuff like this.The other 2 headline features are equally exciting: Agent Swarm (only for paid users on the Kimi app) which &#8220;learns to self-direct an agent swarm of up to 100 sub-agents, executing parallel workflows across up to 1,500 coordinated steps, without predefined roles or hand-crafted workflows.&#8221; This parallelism results in higher end result performance with up to 4.5x faster speed&#8230; ignoring token cost of course.For illustration, here is the output for:\"build a list of the top 100 funded ai startups (make sure they're actually Al - we want things like perplexity and cursor and cognition and elevenlabs and turbopuffer, NOT pretenders... use your best jdugement for criteria) and sort by valuation. use authoritative sources like Techcrunch and TheInformation and top VC firms like Sequoia, Benchmark, Redpoint, Greylock, and Conviction, as well as guests from the Latent Space podcast and Al Engineer conferences. augment the list with useful and interesting facts eg where they are based, size of team, short description of product, what their incumbents/competitors might be, what their bull case is, what Paul Graham would advise them to do.\"and &#8220;Office Productivity&#8221; with K2.5 Agent focused on &#8220;high-density, large-scale office work end to end&#8221;.This is not empty regurgitation - We saw enough to sign up as a paying subscriber of the Kimi App going forward. As Artificial Analysis notes, the China-Western gap in open models just took another big leap today.AI Twitter RecapMoonshotAI&#8217;s Kimi K2.5 ecosystem: open multimodal MoE + &#8220;Agent Swarm&#8221; pushKimi K2.5 model drop and positioning: Moonshot positions Kimi K2.5 as a flagship open-weights model with native multimodality (image + video), strong agentic performance, and aggressive API pricing/latency claims. Official launch media and messaging: founder intro video, pricing/throughput claims incl. &#8220;Turbo-level speed 60&#8211;100 tok/s&#8221;, plus early community reactions emphasizing &#8220;agent swarm&#8221; and multimodal capability (kimmonismus, kimmonismus on multimodal/video).Technical gist (as surfaced by the community): A useful unpacking of K2.5&#8217;s reported ingredients&#8212;~15T mixed visual+text tokens continual pretraining, context 128K&#8594;256K via YaRN, release in INT4 with selective quantization (only routed experts quantized), and the &#8220;Agent Swarm&#8221; orchestration concept (dynamic generation of subagents; up to 100 parallel subagents / 1,500 steps; wall-time improvements claimed 3&#8211;4.5&#215;) is summarized by @TheZachMueller (and points to the technical report).Benchmarks/third-party eval framing: Artificial Analysis positions K2.5 as &#8220;leading open weights&#8221; and closer to frontier labs, highlighting GDPval-AA Elo 1309 (agentic knowledge work harness), MMMU Pro 75%, INT4 ~595GB, and a 64% hallucination rate (improved vs K2 Thinking) among other stats: @ArtificialAnlys. LMArena announcements also place K2.5 Thinking at #1 open model in their Text Arena snapshot: @arena. (Treat leaderboards as point-in-time; harness/tooling and prompting matter.)Distribution and &#8220;runs at home&#8221; signals: K2.5 landed quickly across infra surfaces: Ollama cloud with launch integrations (@ollama), Together AI listing (@togethercompute), and Fireworks as a partner (Moonshot). A notable local-inference datapoint: K2.5 reportedly runs (slowly but &#8220;usable&#8221;) on 2&#215; M3 Ultra via MLX with sharded generation, ~21.9 tok/s at high memory use: @awnihannun (+ command snippet here).Product surface area around Kimi: Moonshot also pushed adjacent tooling: Kimi Code, an Apache-2.0 open-source coding agent integrating with common IDEs/editors (announcement), and an Agent SDK to build custom agents (link). A &#8220;Kimi Product&#8221; account is explicitly aimed at distributing prompts/use-cases (launch), with a viral demo of &#8220;video-to-code&#8221; website cloning (demo).Open &#8220;American comeback&#8221; at scale: Arcee/Prime Intellect Trinity Large Preview (400B MoE)Trinity Large Preview release: Arcee dropped Trinity Large initial weights as a &#8220;preview&#8221; release: @arcee_ai, with expanded details from @latkins. Prime Intellect frames it as an open 400B MoE with 13B active trained with Datology data: @PrimeIntellect. OpenRouter offered limited-time free access: @OpenRouterAI.Architecture/training details (most concrete technical tweet): A strong technical snapshot comes from @samsja19: 400B/A13B MoE, trained over 17T tokens; 3:1 interleaved local/global gated attention, SWA, NoPE on global layers + RoPE on local layers (as written in tweet), depth-scaled sandwich norm, sigmoid routing, trained with Muon; trained on ~2,000 B300s for a month on Prime Intellect infra, with data curation by DatologyAI.Data scaling emphasis: Datology&#8217;s involvement is highlighted as a major part of the project: &#8220;6.5T tokens overall&#8221; and &#8220;800B synthetic code&#8221; (plus multilingual curation) in one team member&#8217;s recap: @code_star. Separate recaps mention 8T synthetic as part of 17T: @pratyushmaini.Ecosystem readiness: vLLM announced day-0 support for serving Trinity Large: @vllm_project. The meta-story in the replies is that a Western org is again attempting frontier-ish pretraining from scratch with an open model, rather than only post-training/evals.Agents everywhere: orchestration, subagents, planning critics, and IDE/CLI integrationAgent &#8220;swarm&#8221; vs &#8220;subagents&#8221; convergence: Kimi&#8217;s &#8220;Agent Swarm&#8221; pitch (dynamic subagent creation) parallels the broader pattern of central orchestrator + parallel specialists. The most explicit &#8220;starter pattern&#8221; articulation is LangChain&#8217;s stateless subagent model (parallel execution + minimized context bloat): @sydneyrunkle. Meanwhile, Kimi&#8217;s swarm is framed as trainable orchestration via Parallel-Agent RL (PARL) in community summaries (Zach Mueller).Reliability via &#8220;critique before execute&#8221;: Google&#8217;s Jules introduced a Planning Critic&#8212;a second agent that critiques plans pre-execution, claiming a 9.5% drop in task failure rates: @julesagent.

The post suggests that personal investors should consider these developments as Chinese firms issue IPOs, with a16z noting that 80% of startups pitching them use Chinese open-source AI models. A comment questions whether Kimi K2 is superior to GLM 4.7, indicating a debate on the relative performance of these models in specific contexts.The discussion compares the performance of the Kimi K2 model with the GLM 4.7 model. Kimi K2 is noted for its efficiency in specific tasks, potentially outperforming GLM 4.7 in certain benchmarks. However, the choice between these models may depend on the specific use case, as GLM 4.7 might excel in different areas. The conversation highlights the importance of evaluating models based on task-specific performance metrics rather than general claims of superiority.2. Gemini AI Studio and Usage LimitationsGemini AI Studio is basically unusable now. Any other LLMs with a 1M context window? (Activity: 162): Gemini AI Studio has become less viable for users due to Google’s reduction in daily prompt limits, impacting workflows that rely on its 1 million token context window. Users working with extensive documents and conversations are seeking alternatives. Notably, Grok 4.1 offers a 2 million token context window, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 provides a 1 million token context window within the Kilo Code environment. These alternatives may serve users needing large-context capabilities. Some users suggest that effective CLI tools like Claudie-cli or codex-cli can mitigate the need for massive context windows by efficiently managing and retrieving information from large texts.Coldshalamov mentions that Grok 4.1 fast offers a 2M context window, which is double the size of the 1M context window being discussed. This suggests that Grok 4.1 fast could be a viable alternative for those needing larger context windows.Unlucky_Quote6394 highlights that Claude Sonnet 4.5 provides a 1M context window when used within Kilo Code, indicating another option for users seeking large context capabilities.Ryanmonroe82 suggests embedding documents as an alternative to using cloud models, implying that this method could be more efficient and effective for handling large text data without relying on extensive context windows.32,768 or (2^15) tokens in hot memory.... Gemini has been PURPOSELY THROTTLED by Alphabet and been made into a bait and switch. Gemini Pro is WORSE than the free version as of TODAY. They market over a million tokens for Pro users. This is fraud. (Activity: 858): The Reddit post claims that Alphabet has intentionally throttled the token limit for Gemini Pro to 32,768 tokens, which is significantly lower than the advertised capacity of over a million tokens. This throttling allegedly degrades the performance of Gemini Pro, making it less effective than the free version. The post also mentions that the Ultra and Enterprise versions have a hard cap of 131,072 tokens, despite advertising up to 2 million tokens. The author expresses concern that this limitation could drive users away, especially with potential integration into Siri. Commenters express dissatisfaction with Gemini’s performance, comparing it unfavorably to older models like GPT-3. There is also criticism of the memory management, with claims that it leads to data inaccuracies and inefficiencies.Substantial_Net9923 highlights a significant issue with Gemini’s memory management, noting that the model’s memory loss due to indexing is problematic. This inefficiency is particularly evident in quantitative finance trading discussions, where the model is reportedly generating inaccurate data more frequently than before, suggesting a decline in reliability.klopppppppp observes a drastic decline in Gemini’s performance, comparing it to older models like GPT-3. Despite this, they note that Gemini still performs exceptionally well in ‘deep research mode,’ indicating that the model’s capabilities might be context-dependent or throttled in certain scenarios.SorryDistribution604 expresses frustration with Gemini’s recent performance, likening it to older models such as GPT-3. This suggests a perceived regression in the model’s capabilities, which could be due to throttling or other limitations imposed on the Pro version.About the recent AI Studio Limit Downgrade: (Activity: 660): The image is a notification from the Gemini API about a reduction in free usage limits for AI Studio users, suggesting a transition to using an API key for continued access. It indicates that these limits may decrease further over time, and mentions ongoing efforts to integrate with Google AI Pro/Ultra to share limits within AI Studio. This change reflects a broader trend of tightening access to free AI resources, potentially impacting developers relying on these tools for experimentation and development. Commenters express frustration over the reduction in free usage limits, noting that Gemini’s performance in following instructions has also declined. There is a sentiment that these changes are detrimental to AI Studio’s utility, as users feel they are receiving less value and functionality.trashyslashers highlights a significant issue with the Gemini model’s performance, noting that it is ‘getting worse at listening to instructions.’ This suggests a degradation in the model’s ability to follow user commands, which is compounded by the reduction in daily usage limits. Users are forced to ‘rewrite and regenerate’ requests, indicating inefficiencies in the model’s processing capabilities.Decent_Ingenuity5413 raises concerns about the stability and reliability of AI Studio’s service, drawing parallels to OpenAI’s past issues with unexpected changes. The comment also points out a critical billing issue with the Gemini API, where users have experienced ‘massive overbilling’ due to token counting errors, leading to charges exceeding $70,000. This highlights a significant flaw in the billing system that could deter average consumers from using the API.Sensitive_Shift1489 expresses frustration over the perceived downgrading of AI Studio in favor of other Google AI products like Gemini App and CLI. The comment implies that these changes are part of a broader strategy to shift focus and resources, potentially at the expense of AI Studio’s quality and user satisfaction.3.

      "title": "MBZUAI Releases K2 Think V2: A Fully Sovereign 70B Reasoning Model For Math, Code, And Science",
      "content": "Can a fully sovereign open reasoning model match state of the art systems when every part of its training pipeline is transparent. Researchers from Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) release K2 Think V2, a fully sovereign reasoning model designed to test how far open and fully documented pipelines can push long horizon reasoning on math, code, and science when the entire stack is open and reproducible. K2 Think V2 takes the 70 billion parameter K2 V2 Instruct base model and applies a carefully engineered reinforcement learning approach to turn it into a high precision reasoning model that remains fully open in both weights and data.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06201\n\n\nFrom K2 V2 base model to reasoning specialist\n\n\n\nK2 V2 is a dense decoder only transformer with 80 layers, hidden size 8192, and 64 attention heads with grouped query attention and rotary position embeddings. It is trained on around 12 trillion tokens drawn from the TxT360 corpus and related curated datasets that cover web text, math, code, multilingual data, and scientific literature. \n\n\n\nTraining proceeds in three phases. Pretraining runs at context length 8192 tokens on natural data to establish robust general knowledge. Mid training then extends context up to 512k tokens using TxT360 Midas, which mixes long documents, synthetic thinking traces, and diverse reasoning behaviors while carefully keeping at least 30 percent short context data in every stage. Finally, supervised fine tuning, called TxT360 3efforts, injects instruction following and structured reasoning signals.\n\n\n\nThe important point is that K2 V2 is not a generic base model. It is explicitly optimized for long context consistency and exposure to reasoning behaviors during mid training. That makes it a natural foundation for a post training stage that focuses only on reasoning quality, which is exactly what K2 Think V2 does.\n\n\n\nFully sovereign RLVR on GURU dataset\n\n\n\nK2 Think V2 is trained with a GRPO style RLVR recipe on top of K2 V2 Instruct. The team uses the Guru dataset, version 1.5, which focuses on math, code, and STEM questions. Guru is derived from permissively licensed sources, expanded in STEM coverage, and decontaminated against key evaluation benchmarks before use. This is important for a sovereign claim, because both the base model data and the RL data are curated and documented by the same institute. \n\n\n\nThe GRPO setup removes the usual KL and entropy auxiliary losses and uses asymmetric clipping of the policy ratio with the high clip set to 0.28. Training runs fully on policy with temperature 1.2 to increase rollout diversity, global batch size 256, and no micro batching. This avoids off policy corrections that are known to introduce instability in GRPO like training. \n\n\n\nRLVR itself runs in two stages. In the first stage, response length is capped at 32k tokens and the model trains for about 200 steps. In the second stage, the maximum response length is increased to 64k tokens and training continues for about 50 steps with the same hyperparameters. This schedule specifically exploits the long context capability inherited from K2 V2 so that the model can practice full chain of thought trajectories rather than short solutions. \n\n\n\nhttps://mbzuai.ac.ae/news/k2-think-v2-a-fully-sovereign-reasoning-model/\n\n\nBenchmark profile\n\n\n\nK2 Think V2 targets reasoning benchmarks rather than purely knowledge benchmarks. On AIME 2025 it reaches pass at 1 of 90.42. On HMMT 2025 it scores 84.79. On GPQA Diamond, a difficult graduate level science benchmark, it reaches 72.98. On SciCode it records 33.00, and on Humanity’s Last Exam it reaches 9.5 under the benchmark settings. \n\n\n\nThese scores are reported as averages over 16 runs and are directly comparable only within the same evaluation protocol. The MBZUAI team also highlights improvements on IFBench and on the Artificial Analysis evaluation suite, with particular gains in hallucination rate and long context reasoning compared with the previous K2 Think release. \n\n\n\nSafety and openness\n\n\n\nThe research team reports a Safety 4 style analysis that aggregates four safety surfaces. Content and public safety, truthfulness and reliability, and societal alignment all reach macro average risk levels in the low range.

      "content_html": "<p>Can a fully sovereign open reasoning model match state of the art systems when every part of its training pipeline is transparent. Researchers from Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) release K2 Think V2, a fully sovereign reasoning model designed to test how far open and fully documented pipelines can push long horizon reasoning on math, code, and science when the entire stack is open and reproducible. K2 Think V2 takes the 70 billion parameter K2 V2 Instruct base model and applies a carefully engineered reinforcement learning approach to turn it into a high precision reasoning model that remains fully open in both weights and data.</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06201</p>\n<p>From K2 V2 base model to reasoning specialist</p>\n<p>K2 V2 is a dense decoder only transformer with 80 layers, hidden size 8192, and 64 attention heads with grouped query attention and rotary position embeddings. It is trained on around 12 trillion tokens drawn from the TxT360 corpus and related curated datasets that cover web text, math, code, multilingual data, and scientific literature.</p>\n<p>Training proceeds in three phases. Pretraining runs at context length 8192 tokens on natural data to establish robust general knowledge. Mid training then extends context up to 512k tokens using TxT360 Midas, which mixes long documents, synthetic thinking traces, and diverse reasoning behaviors while carefully keeping at least 30 percent short context data in every stage. Finally, supervised fine tuning, called TxT360 3efforts, injects instruction following and structured reasoning signals.</p>\n<p>The important point is that K2 V2 is not a generic base model. It is explicitly optimized for long context consistency and exposure to reasoning behaviors during mid training. That makes it a natural foundation for a post training stage that focuses only on reasoning quality, which is exactly what K2 Think V2 does.</p>\n<p>Fully sovereign RLVR on GURU dataset</p>\n<p>K2 Think V2 is trained with a GRPO style RLVR recipe on top of K2 V2 Instruct. The team uses the Guru dataset, version 1.5, which focuses on math, code, and STEM questions. Guru is derived from permissively licensed sources, expanded in STEM coverage, and decontaminated against key evaluation benchmarks before use. This is important for a sovereign claim, because both the base model data and the RL data are curated and documented by the same institute.</p>\n<p>The GRPO setup removes the usual KL and entropy auxiliary losses and uses asymmetric clipping of the policy ratio with the high clip set to 0.28. Training runs fully on policy with temperature 1.2 to increase rollout diversity, global batch size 256, and no micro batching. This avoids off policy corrections that are known to introduce instability in GRPO like training.</p>\n<p>RLVR itself runs in two stages. In the first stage, response length is capped at 32k tokens and the model trains for about 200 steps. In the second stage, the maximum response length is increased to 64k tokens and training continues for about 50 steps with the same hyperparameters. This schedule specifically exploits the long context capability inherited from K2 V2 so that the model can practice full chain of thought trajectories rather than short solutions.</p>\n<p>https://mbzuai.ac.ae/news/k2-think-v2-a-fully-sovereign-reasoning-model/</p>\n<p>Benchmark profile</p>\n<p>K2 Think V2 targets reasoning benchmarks rather than purely knowledge benchmarks. On AIME 2025 it reaches pass at 1 of 90.42. On HMMT 2025 it scores 84.79. On GPQA Diamond, a difficult graduate level science benchmark, it reaches 72.98. On SciCode it records 33.00, and on Humanity’s Last Exam it reaches 9.5 under the benchmark settings.</p>\n<p>These scores are reported as averages over 16 runs and are directly comparable only within the same evaluation protocol. The MBZUAI team also highlights improvements on IFBench and on the Artificial Analysis evaluation suite, with particular gains in hallucination rate and long context reasoning compared with the previous K2 Think release.</p>\n<p>Safety and openness</p>\n<p>The research team reports a Safety 4 style analysis that aggregates four safety surfaces. Content and public safety, truthfulness and reliability, and societal alignment all reach macro average risk levels in the low range. Data and infrastructure risks remain higher and are marked as critical, which reflects concerns about sensitive personal information handling rather than model behavior alone. The team states that K2 Think V2 still shares the generic limitations of large language models despite these mitigations. On Artificial Analysis’s Openness Index, K2 Think V2 sits at the frontier together with K2 V2 and Olmo-3.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>K2 Think V2 is a fully sovereign 70B reasoning model: Built on K2 V2 Instruct, with open weights, open data recipes, detailed training logs, and full RL pipeline released via Reasoning360.</p>\n<p>Base model is optimized for long context and reasoning before RL: K2 V2 is a dense decoder transformer trained on around 12T tokens, with mid training extending context length to 512K tokens and supervised ‘3 efforts’ SFT targeting structured reasoning.</p>\n<p>Reasoning is aligned using GRPO based RLVR on the Guru dataset: Training uses a 2 stage on policy GRPO setup on Guru v1.5, with asymmetric clipping, temperature 1.2, and response caps at 32K then 64K tokens to learn long chain of thought solutions.</p>\n<p>Competitive results on hard reasoning benchmarks: K2 Think V2 reports strong pass at 1 scores such as 90.42 on AIME 2025, 84.79 on HMMT 2025, and 72.98 on GPQA Diamond, positioning it as a high precision open reasoning model for math, code, and science.</p>\n<p>Check out the&nbsp;Paper, Model Weight, Repo and Technical details.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.

      "title": "Deloitte sounds alarm as AI agent deployment outruns safety frameworks",
      "content": "A new report from Deloitte has warned that businesses are deploying AI agents faster than their safety protocols and safeguards can keep up. Therefore, serious concerns around security, data privacy, and accountability are spreading.\nAccording to the survey, agentic systems are moving from pilot to production so quickly that traditional risk controls, which were designed for more human-centred operations, are struggling to meet security demands.\nJust 21% of organisations have implemented stringent governance or oversight for AI agents, despite the increased rate of adoption. Whilst 23% of companies stated that they are currently using AI agents, this is expected to rise to 74% in the next two years. The share of businesses yet to adopt this technology is expected to fall from 25% to just 5% over the same period.\nPoor governance is the threat\nDeloitte is not highlighting AI agents as inherently dangerous, but states the real risks are associated with poor context and weak governance. If agents operate as their own entities, their decisions and actions can easily become opaque. Without robust governance, it becomes difficult to manage and almost impossible to insure against mistakes.\nAccording to Ali Sarrafi, CEO &amp; Founder of Kovant, the answer is governed autonomy. “Well-designed agents with clear boundaries, policies and definitions managed the same way as an enterprise manages any worker can move fast on low-risk work inside clear guardrails, but escalate to humans when actions cross defined risk thresholds.”\n“With detailed action logs, observability, and human gatekeeping for high-impact decisions, agents stop being mysterious bots and become systems you can inspect, audit, and trust.”\nAs Deloitte&#8217;s report suggests, AI agent adoption is set to accelerate in the coming years, and only the companies that deploy the technology with visibility and control will hold the upper hand over competitors, not those who deploy them quickest.\nWhy AI agents require robust guardrails\nAI agents may perform well in controlled demos, but they struggle in real-world business settings where systems can be fragmented and data may be inconsistent.\nSarrafi commented on the unpredictable nature of AI agents in these scenarios. “When an agent is given too much context or scope at once, it becomes prone to hallucinations and unpredictable behaviour.”\n“By contrast, production-grade systems limit the decision and context scope that models work with. They decompose operations into narrower, focused tasks for individual agents, making behaviour more predictable and easier to control. This structure also enables traceability and intervention, so failures can be detected early and escalated appropriately rather than causing cascading errors.”\nAccountability for insurable AI\nWith agents taking real actions in business systems, such as keeping detailed action logs, risk and compliance are viewed differently. With every action recorded, agents&#8217; activities become clear and evaluable, letting organisations inspect actions in detail.\nSuch transparency is crucial for insurers, who are reluctant to cover opaque AI systems. This level of detail helps insurers understand what agents have done, and the controls involved, thus making it easier to assess risk. With human oversight for risk-critical actions and auditable, replayable workflows, organisations can produce systems that are more manageable for risk assessment.\nAAIF standards a good first step\nShared standards, like those being developed by the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), help businesses to integrate different agent systems, but current standardisation efforts focus on what is simplest to build, not what larger organisations need to operate agentic systems safely.\nSarrafi says enterprises require standards that support operation control, and which include, “access permissions, approval workflows for high-impact actions, and auditable logs and observability, so teams can monitor behaviour, investigate incidents, and prove compliance.”\nIdentity and permissions the first line of defence\nLimiting what AI agents can access and the actions they can perform is important to ensure safety in real business environments. Sarrafi said, “When agents are given broad privileges or too much context, they become unpredictable and pose security or compliance risks.”\nVisibility and monitoring are important to keep agents operating inside limits. Only then can stakeholders have confidence in the adoption of the technology. If every action is logged and manageable, teams can then see what has happened, identify issues, and better understand why events occurred.\nSarrafi continued, “This visibility, combined with human supervision where it matters, turns AI agents from inscrutable components into systems that can be inspected, replayed and audited. It also allows rapid investigation and correction when issues arise, which boosts trust among operators, risk teams and insurers alike.”\nDeloitte&#8217;s blueprint\nDeloitte&#8217;s strategy for safe AI agent governance sets out defined boundaries for the decisions agentic systems can make. For instance, they might operate with tiered autonomy, where agents can only view information or offer suggestions. From here, they can be allowed to take limited actions, but with human approval. Once they have proven to be reliable in low-risk areas, they can be allowed to act automatically.\nDeloitte&#8217;s “Cyber AI Blueprints” suggest governance layers and embedding policies and compliance capability roadmaps into organisational controls. Ultimately, governance structures that track AI use and risk, and embedding oversight into daily operations are important for safe agentic AI use.\nReadying workforces with training is another aspect of safe governance. Deloitte recommends training employees on what they shouldn&#8217;t share with AI systems, what to do if agents go off track, and how to spot unusual, potentially dangerous behaviour. If employees fail to understand how AI systems work and their potential risks, they may weaken security controls, albeit unintentionally.\nRobust governance and control, alongside shared literacy are fundamental to the safe deployment and operation of AI agents, enabling secure, compliant, and accountable performance in real-world environments\n(Image source: &#8220;Global Hawk, NASA&#8217;s New Remote-Controlled Plane&#8221; by NASA Goddard Photo and Video is licensed under CC BY 2.0. )\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "title": "Tencent Hunyuan Releases HPC-Ops: A High Performance LLM Inference Operator Library",
      "content": "Tencent Hunyuan has open sourced HPC-Ops, a production grade operator library for large language model inference architecture devices. HPC-Ops focuses on low level CUDA kernels for core operators such as Attention, Grouped GEMM, and Fused MoE, and exposes them through a compact-C and Python API for integration into existing inference stacks.\n\n\n\nHPC-Ops runs in large scale internal services. In those deployments it delivers about 30 percent queries per minute improvement for Tencent-HY models and about 17 percent improvement for DeepSeek models on mainstream inference cards. These gains are reported at the service level, so they reflect the cumulative effect of faster kernels inside a real inference pipeline.\n\n\n\nScope and design of HPC-Ops\n\n\n\nHPC-Ops is a production grade, high performance, and easy to use operator library for LLM inference, developed by the Tencent Hunyuan AI Infra team. The project does not try to replace serving frameworks. Instead it provides kernels and clean APIs that can be called from systems that already handle scheduling, KV cache management, batching, and transport.\n\n\n\nThe API is designed for seamless use inside popular inference frameworks such as vLLM and SGLang. That means the framework team can swap in HPC-Ops kernels behind their own abstractions without changing the external behavior of their servers. \n\n\n\nHPC-Ops uses C++ and CUDA with CuTe and CUTLASS as building blocks. Kernels are written as relatively small examples that also serve as a modern CUDA tutorial.\n\n\n\nKernel performance characteristics\n\n\n\nThe project publishes maximum observed speedup numbers for each operator relative to established baselines. These are microbenchmarks, and the research team stress that performance varies across shapes and workloads, but they show the optimization ceiling. \n\n\n\nFor Attention in bf16, compared with FlashInfer, FlashAttention two, FlashAttention three, and TensorRT LLM, HPC Ops reports up to 1.33 times speedup in prefill and up to 2.22 times in decode. For Attention in fp8, compared with FlashInfer, FlashAttention three, and TensorRT LLM, it reports up to 1.12 times in prefill and up to 2.0 times in decode.\n\n\n\nFor FusedMoE fp8, compared with TensorRT LLM and vLLM, maximum observed speedup is up to 1.49 times in prefill and 1.14 times in decode. For GroupGEMM fp8, compared with DeepGEMM, the reported gains are up to 1.1 times in prefill and 1.88 times in decode. \n\n\n\nThese numbers matter because decode is usually the latency bottleneck in autoregressive generation, where batch sizes shrink and memory traffic dominates. The fact that Attention and GroupGEMM show the largest relative gains in decode suggests that HPC-Ops focuses on the part of the pipeline that most users notice.\n\n\n\nSupported kernels and precision\n\n\n\nThe current release groups its functionality into three operator families:\n\n\n\n\nAttention kernels cover both prefill and decode and include support for paged attention. Paged attention is the memory layout that frameworks like vLLM use to place key and value cache blocks in a paged structure, which improves memory reuse for long sequences. \n\n\n\nGrouped GEMM is implemented as quantized GroupGEMM with fp8 weights. HPC-Ops supports block wise and per tensor scaling, so teams can trade off quantization granularity against parameter storage and calibration cost. \n\n\n\nFused-MoE combines mixture of experts routing and expert computation in a single quantized operator. It also uses fp8 expert weights and supports block wise and per tensor scaling strategies.\n\n\n\n\nAcross these kernels, HPC-Ops provides native support for bf16 and fp8 data types. That matches the current production trend to move inference toward lower precision formats that preserve accuracy while reducing memory bandwidth and improving tensor core utilization. \n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nTencent Hunyuan open-sourced HPC-Ops as a production grade operator library for LLM inference on NVIDIA SM90 GPUs, including H20, with C++ and CUDA kernels built on CuTe and CUTLASS.\n\n\n\nIn production deployments HPC-Ops reports about 30 percent QPM gain for Tencent-HY models and about 17 percent QPM gain for DeepSeek models on mainstream inference cards.\n\n\n\nOperator microbenchmarks show maximum speedups up to 2.22 times for bf16 Attention decode, up to 2.0 times for fp8 Attention decode, up to 1.49 times for fp8 FusedMoE prefill, and up to 1.88 times for fp8 GroupGEMM decode compared with strong baselines like FlashInfer, FlashAttention, TensorRT LLM, and DeepGEMM.\n\n\n\nThe library focuses on three operator families, Attention with paged attention support, quantized GroupGEMM with fp8 weights, and quantized Fused MoE with fp8 expert weights, with both block wise and per tensor scaling, and native bf16 plus fp8 precision support.\n\n\n\nHPC-Ops is designed as an operator layer that integrates into existing inference frameworks such as vLLM and SGLang, and the roadmap targets sparse attention for long context LLMs, extended quantization including 4 bit and 8 bit strategies, and kernels that better overlap computation with multi GPU communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Repo here. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content": "A White House paper titled &#8220;Artificial Intelligence and the Great Divergence&#8221; sets out parallels between the effects of the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries and the current times, with artificial intelligence positioned as guiding the way the world&#8217;s economies will be shaped.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence now sits at the centre of US economic strategy, currently representing a significant portion of the country&#8217;s economic activity, as characterised by the building of AI infrastructure, most notably in the form of data centres. The paper says AI investment raised US GDP by 1.3% percent in the first half of 2025, and compares this with the investment in the railway network during the industrial revolution.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Artificial Intelligence and the Great Divergence&#8221; says long-term growth depends primarily on gains in productivity, and AI is the tool to achieve those gains. It presents a range of estimates of AI&#8217;s impact on GDP, from single-digit increases to 20% productivity growth inside a decade. It also floats some more extreme scenarios, where GDP grows at more than 45% as AI substitutes for human labour in the longer term.\n\n\n\nCapital deployment in the form of building AI infrastructure, not growing consumption or public spending, is now creating US economic growth. Investment in data processing equipment, buildings, infrastructure, and software grew 28% in early 2025, and AI-related infrastructure represented around a quarter of all US investment in 2025.\n\n\n\nTraining compute capacity used by AI models has increased roughly four-fold per year since 2010, and the length of tasks AI systems can complete has doubled every seven months for six years, the paper states. The cost per token of AI output has fallen by factors ranging from nine to nine hundred per year, depending on task and model.\n\n\n\nBy late 2025, around 78% percent of organisations had reported using AI, up from 55% in 2024, and it&#8217;s claimed that 40% of US workers use generative AI in their jobs. Nearly half of US businesses now pay for AI subscriptions. The report poses these figures as evidence that AI has moved from experimentation into routine production.\n\n\n\nInternationally, the document frames AI as a factor in divergence of economic prosperity, with AI in the US increasing America&#8217;s GDP growth faster than in Europe and China. The US leads at the moment in private AI investment, model development, and compute capacity, while the EU&#8217;s share of world GDP has fallen since 1980. Additionally, the continent lags in comparable AI metrics – investment, construction, software development, overall capacity, etc. China remains a major player in AI actor, but the report notes that much of its model training relies on US-designed hardware.\n\n\n\nThe White House publication advocates for an integrated national strategy with investment incentives at its core. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave significant financial breaks for data centres and IT infrastructure, and created favourable conditions for speedy facility construction, in line with the Act&#8217;s aim to lift GDP growth by more than a percentage point per year over the medium term. The report argues that deregulation in the AI industry supports productivity by lowering costs, increasing competition, and speeding innovation. Trade agreements and foreign policy reinforce this approach, with overseas partners committing to large purchases of US-derived AI chips and infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe paper notes that AI data centres are electricity-intensive, and projects that demand for power by AI infrastructure could reach up to 12% of domestic electricity consumption by 2028. It links the success of AI to energy availability and the ability of the power grid to deliver, positioning the control of energy supply as a prerequisite for international leadership in AI.\n\n\n\nThe report&#8217;s conclusion is that the countries that lead in AI investment and adoption will experience higher growth than the mean. The United States is aligning multiple policy rafts to ensure its leading position in the sector.

      "title": "Context Management for Deep Agents",
      "content": "By Chester Curme and Mason DaughertyAs the addressable task length of AI agents continues to grow, effective context management becomes critical to prevent context rot and to manage LLMs&#x2019; finite memory constraints.The Deep Agents SDK is LangChain&#x2019;s open source, batteries-included agent harness. It provides an easy path to build agents with the ability to plan, spawn subagents, and work with a filesystem to execute complex, long-running tasks. Because these sorts of tasks can generally exceed models&#x2019; context windows, the SDK implements various features that facilitate context compression.Context compression refers to techniques that reduce the volume of information in an agent&apos;s working memory while preserving the details relevant to completing the task. This might involve summarizing previous interactions, filtering out stale information, or strategically deciding what to retain and what to discard.Deep Agents implements a filesystem abstraction that allows agents to perform operations such as listing, reading, and writing files, as well as search, pattern matching, and file execution. Agents use the filesystem to search and retrieve offloaded content as needed.Deep Agents implements three main compression techniques, triggered at different frequencies:Offloading large tool results: We offload large tool responses to the filesystem whenever they occur.Offloading large tool inputs: When the context size crosses a threshold, we offload old write/edit arguments from tool calls to the filesystem.Summarization: When the context size crosses the threshold, and there is no more context eligible for offloading, we perform a summarization step to compress the message history.To manage context limits, the Deep Agents SDK triggers these compression steps at threshold fractions of the model&apos;s context window size. (Under the hood, we use LangChain&apos;s model profiles to access the token threshold for a given model.)Offloading large tool resultsResponses from tool invocations (e.g., the result of reading a large file or an API call) can exceed a model&apos;s context window. When Deep Agents detects a tool response exceeding 20,000 tokens, it offloads the response to the filesystem and substitutes it with a file path reference and a preview of the first 10 lines. Agents can then re-read or search the content as needed.Offloading large tool inputsFile write and edit operations leave behind tool calls containing the complete file content in the agent&apos;s conversation history. Since this content is already persisted to the filesystem, it&apos;s often redundant. As the session context crosses 85% of the model&#x2019;s available window, Deep Agents will truncate older tool calls, replacing them with a pointer to the file on disk and reducing the size of the active context.SummarizationWhen offloading no longer yields sufficient space, Deep Agents falls back to summarization. This process has two components:In-context summary: An LLM generates a structured summary of the conversation&#x2014;including session intent, artifacts created, and next steps&#x2014;which replaces the full conversation history in the agent&apos;s working memory. (See the Deep Agents summarization prompt.)Filesystem preservation: The complete, original conversation messages are written to the filesystem as a canonical record.This dual approach ensures the agent maintains awareness of its goals and progress (via the summary) while preserving the ability to recover specific details when needed (via filesystem search). See an example in this trace, where the model uses the read_file tool to fetch previously offloaded messages.What this looks like in practiceWhile the techniques above provide the machinery for context management, how do we know they&apos;re actually working? Runs on real-world tasks, as captured in benchmarks such as terminal-bench, may trigger context compression sporadically, making it difficult to isolate their impact.We&#x2019;ve found it useful to increase the signal of individual features of the harness by engaging them more aggressively on benchmark datasets. For example, while triggering summarization at 10 - 20% of the available context window may lead to suboptimal overall performance, it produces significantly more summarization events. This allows for different configurations (e.g., variations of your implementation) to be compared. For example, by forcing the agent to summarize frequently, we could identify how simple changes to the deepagents summarization prompt, in which we added dedicated fields for the session intent and next steps, help improve performance.Figure: Token usage over time in sample runs of Claude Sonnet 4.5 on terminal-bench-2 (gray lines show all runs; colored lines highlight two specific examples). The green line shows a dramatic token drop around turn 20 when a summarization event compresses the conversation history. The orange line shows a smaller reduction around turn 40 when a large file write tool call is evicted from context. By triggering compression at 25% of the context window (rather than the Deep Agents default of 85%), we generate more events to study.Targeted evalsThe Deep Agents SDK maintains a set of targeted evaluations designed to isolate and validate individual context-management mechanisms. These are deliberately small tests that make specific failure modes obvious and debuggable.The goal of these evals is not to measure broad task-solving ability, but to ensure that the agent&#x2019;s harness does not get in the way of certain tasks. For example:Did summarization preserve the agent&#x2019;s objective? Some evals deliberately trigger summarization mid-task and then check whether the agent continues. This ensures that summarization preserves not only agent state but also its trajectory.Can the agent recover information that was summarized away? Here we embed a &#x201c;needle-in-the-haystack&#x201d; fact early in the conversation, force a summarization event, and then require the agent to recall that fact later to complete the task. The fact is not present in the active context after summarization and must be recovered via filesystem search.These targeted evals act as integration tests for context management: they don&#x2019;t replace full benchmark runs, but they significantly reduce iteration time and make failures attributable to specific compression mechanisms rather than overall agent behavior.GuidanceWhen evaluating your own context compression strategies, we&#x2019;d emphasize:Start with real-world benchmarks, then stress-test individual features. Run your harness on representative tasks first to establish baseline performance. Then, artificially trigger compression more aggressively (e.g., at 10-20% of context instead of 85%) to generate more compression events per run. This amplifies the signal from individual features, making it easier to compare different approaches (e.g. variations in your summarization prompt).Test recoverability. Context compression is only useful if critical information remains accessible. Include targeted tests that verify agents can both continue toward their original goal after compression and recover specific details when needed (e.g., needle-in-the-haystack scenarios where a key fact is summarized away but must be retrieved later).Monitor for goal drift. The most insidious failure mode is an agent that loses track of the user&apos;s intent after summarization. This may manifest as the agent completing in the turn after summarization to ask for clarification, or to mistakenly declare the task complete. More subtle deviations from the intended task may be harder to attribute to summarization; forcing frequent summarization on sample datasets may help surface these failures.All features of the Deep Agents harness are open source.

      "content": " Artificial intelligence has moved into the US workplace, but its adoption remains uneven, fragmented, and tied to role, industry, and organisation. Findings from a Gallup Workforce survey covering the period to the end of December 2025 show how employees use AI, who benefits most from it, and where areas of uncertainty remain. \n The findings draw from a nationally-representative questioning of more than 23,000 US adults in full- and part-time work, conducted online in August 2025. Its conclusions are that instances of AI in the workplace are increasing, but its use is far from universal, and is concentrated among knowledge-based workers. \n\nThe office AI\n\n Employees in technology, finance, and professional services are by far the biggest user group. More than three-quarters of those working in IT report using AI &#8220;at least a few times a year&#8221;. In finance and professional services, the figure is a touch under 60%. AI-enabled or aided roles tend to be those that involve significant digital workflow and information synthesis; tasks that correspond with AI&#8217;s current abilities. \n AI use is lower in sectors dominated by customer-facing or manual work. Only around a third of retail workers report comparable levels of use to their office counterparts, although those in healthcare and manufacturing do tend to deploy AI more often than those in retail, for example. The fact that current raft of AI platforms fit more naturally into desk-based, cognitive roles seems obvious – less so is a drop-off in user numbers in tightly-regulated environments. \n\n\n\nDo we, or don&#8217;t we?\n\n Gallup&#8217;s data reveals a significant number of workers ore unsure whether or not their employer had adopted AI – nearly a quarter of those surveyed weren&#8217;t sure. In the third quarter of 2025, just over a third of employees said their organisation had implemented AI. 40% said there was no adoption of AI in their place of work \n It&#8217;s worth noting that earlier versions of Gallup surveys didn&#8217;t include a &#8220;don’t know&#8221; option for questions about employers&#8217; AI adoption, which encouraged respondents to guess. Belief in organisational AI adoption appeared to rise sharply between 2024 and 2025, therefore, Gallup says. Once uncertainty could be stated explicitly, it became clear a good number of employees were simply uninformed on the matter. \n It&#8217;s staff in non-managerial roles who are more likely to say they&#8217;re unaware of their organisation&#8217;s AI use, a tendency mirrored in part-time staff and hands-on roles. The further workers are from decision-making, it seems, the less sure they become. \n\n\n\nHow workers use AI\n\n The way employees use AI are consistent: of those using AI at least once a year, the most common applications are consolidating information, searching for information, and &#8220;generating ideas&#8221;, tasks that have changed little since Gallup first measured workplace AI use in 2024. \n More than 60% of AI users refer to chatbots, with using AI for writing and editing coming some way behind. Coding assistants and data science tools remain niche, but popular. Employees who use AI often are far more likely to use any more advanced tools at their disposal; particularly true in the cases of coding assistants and data analysis. \n Although use figures are generally up, Gallup concludes that AI has yet to be embedded in daily work for most Americans. Around 45% of workers say they use AI &#8220;a few times a year&#8221;, but only about 10% use it every day. \n\n\n\nConclusions\n\n Business leaders have an easy win: simply clarifying a position on AI use would be a positive, plus publicising the availability (or otherwise) of AI tools would be an easy way to improve adoption rates. \n The current abilities of AI pertain to desk-based, digital and data-centric workflows, although there are a myriad of platforms that will utilise AI in other roles.

      "title": "How Standard Chartered runs AI under privacy rules",
      "content": "For banks trying to put AI into real use, the hardest questions often come before any model is trained. Can the data be used at all? Where is it allowed to be stored? Who is responsible once the system goes live? At Standard Chartered, these privacy-driven questions now shape how AI systems are built,  and deployed at the bank.\nFor global banks operating in many jurisdictions, these early decisions are rarely straightforward. Privacy rules differ by market, and the same AI system may face very different constraints depending on where it is deployed. At Standard Chartered, this has pushed privacy teams into a more active role in shaping how AI systems are designed, approved, and monitored in the organisation.\n&#8220;Data privacy functions have become the starting point of most AI regulations,&#8221; says David Hardoon, Global Head of AI Enablement at Standard Chartered. In practice, that means privacy requirements shape the type of data that can be used in AI systems, how transparent those systems need to be, and how they are monitored once they are live.\nPrivacy shaping how AI runs\nThe bank is already running AI systems in live environments. The transition from pilots brings practical challenges that are easy to underestimate early on. In small trials, data sources are limited and well understood. In production, AI systems often pull data from many upstream platforms, each with its own structure and quality issues. &#8220;When moving from a contained pilot into live operations, ensuring data quality becomes more challenging with multiple upstream systems and potential schema differences,&#8221; Hardoon says.\nDavid Hardoon, Global Head of AI Enablement at Standard Chartered\nPrivacy rules add further constraints. In some cases, real customer data cannot be used to train models. Instead, teams may rely on anonymised data, which can affect how quickly systems are developed or how well they perform. Live deployments also operate at a much larger scale, increasing the impact of any gaps in controls. As Hardoon puts it, &#8220;As part of responsible and client-centric AI adoption, we prioritise adhering to principles of fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency as data processing scope expands.&#8221;\nGeography and regulation decide where AI works\nWhere AI systems are built and deployed is also shaped by geography. Data protection laws vary in regions, and some countries impose strict rules on where data must be stored and who can access it. These requirements play a direct role in how Standard Chartered deploys AI, particularly for systems that rely on client or personally identifiable information.\n&#8220;Data sovereignty is often a key consideration when operating in different markets and regions,&#8221; Hardoon says. In markets with data localisation rules, AI systems may need to be deployed locally, or designed so that sensitive data does not cross borders. In other cases, shared platforms can be used, provided the right controls are in place. This results in a mix of global and market-specific AI deployments, shaped by local regulation not a single technical preference.\nThe same trade-offs appear in decisions about centralised AI platforms versus local solutions. Large organisations often aim to share models, tools, and oversight in markets to reduce duplication. Privacy laws do not always block this approach. &#8220;In general, privacy regulations do not explicitly prohibit transfer of data, but rather expect appropriate controls to be in place,&#8221; Hardoon says.\nThere are limits: some data cannot move in borders at all, and certain privacy laws apply beyond the country where data was collected. The details can restrict which markets a central platform can serve and where local systems remain necessary. For banks, this often leads to a layered setup, with shared foundations combined with localised AI use cases where regulation demands it.\nHuman oversight remains central\nAs AI becomes more embedded in decision-making, questions around explainability and consent grow harder to avoid. Automation may speed up processes, but it does not remove responsibility. &#8220;Transparency and explainability have become more crucial than before,&#8221; Hardoon says. Even when working with external vendors, accountability remains internal. This has reinforced the need for human oversight in AI systems, particularly where outcomes affect customers or regulatory obligations.\nPeople also play a larger role in privacy risk than technology alone. Processes and controls can be well designed, but they depend on how staff understand and handle data. &#8220;People remain the most important factor when it comes to implementing privacy controls,&#8221; Hardoon says. At Standard Chartered, this has pushed a focus on training and awareness, so teams know what data can be used, how it should be handled, and where the boundaries lie.\nScaling AI under growing regulatory scrutiny requires making privacy and governance easier to apply in practice. One approach the bank is taking is standardisation. By creating pre-approved templates, architectures, and data classifications, teams can move faster without bypassing controls. &#8220;Standardisation and re-usability are important,&#8221; Hardoon explains. Codifying rules around data residency, retention, and access helps turn complex requirements into clearer components that can be reused in AI projects.\nAs more organisations move AI into everyday operations, privacy is not just a compliance hurdle. It is shaping how AI systems are built, where they run, and how much trust they can earn. In banking, that shift is already influencing what AI looks like in practice – and where its limits are set.\n(Photo by Corporate Locations)\nSee also: The quiet work behind Citi&#8217;s 4,000-person internal AI rollout\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "title": "Franny Hsiao, Salesforce: Scaling enterprise AI",
      "content": "Scaling enterprise AI requires overcoming architectural oversights that often stall pilots before production, a challenge that goes far beyond model selection. While generative AI prototypes are easy to spin up, turning them into reliable business assets involves solving the difficult problems of data engineering and governance.\n\n\n\nAhead of AI &amp; Big Data Global 2026 in London, Franny Hsiao, EMEA Leader of AI Architects at Salesforce, discussed why so many initiatives hit a wall and how organisations can architect systems that actually survive the real world.\n\n\n\nThe ‘pristine island’ problem of scaling enterprise AI\n\n\n\nMost failures stem from the environment in which the AI is built. Pilots frequently begin in controlled settings that create a false sense of security, only to crumble when faced with enterprise scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#8220;The single most common architectural oversight that prevents AI pilots from scaling is the failure to architect a production-grade data infrastructure with built-in end to end governance from the start,&#8221; Hsiao explains.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Understandably, pilots often start on ‘pristine islands’ – using small, curated datasets and simplified workflows. But this ignores the messy reality of enterprise data: the complex integration, normalisation, and transformation required to handle real-world volume and variability.&#8221;\n\n\n\nWhen companies attempt to scale these island-based pilots without addressing the underlying data mess, the systems break. Hsiao warns that &#8220;the resulting data gaps and performance issues like inference latency render the AI systems unusable—and, more importantly, untrustworthy.&#8221;\n\n\n\nHsiao argues that the companies successfully bridging this gap are those that &#8220;bake end-to-end observability and guardrails into the entire lifecycle.&#8221; This approach provides &#8220;visibility and control into how effective the AI systems are and how users are adopting the new technology.&#8221;\n\n\n\nEngineering for perceived responsiveness\n\n\n\nAs enterprises deploy large reasoning models – like the ‘Atlas Reasoning Engine’ – they face a trade-off between the depth of the model’s &#8220;thinking&#8221; and the user’s patience. Heavy compute creates latency.\n\n\n\nSalesforce addresses this by focusing on &#8220;perceived responsiveness through Agentforce Streaming,&#8221; according to Hsiao.\n\n\n\n&#8220;This allows us to deliver AI-generated responses progressively, even while the reasoning engine performs heavy computation in the background. It’s an incredibly effective approach for reducing perceived latency, which often stalls production AI.&#8221;\n\n\n\nTransparency also plays a functional role in managing user expectations when scaling enterprise AI. Hsiao elaborates on using design as a trust mechanism: &#8220;By surfacing progress indicators that show the reasoning steps or the tools being used, as well images like spinners and progress bars to depict loading states, we don’t just keep users engaged; we improve perceived responsiveness and build trust.\n\n\n\n“This visibility, combined with strategic model selection – like choosing smaller models for fewer computations, meaning faster response times – and explicit length constraints, ensures the system feels deliberate and responsive.&#8221;\n\n\n\nOffline intelligence at the edge\n\n\n\nFor industries with field operations, such as utilities or logistics, reliance on continuous cloud connectivity is a non-starter. &#8220;For many of our enterprise customers, the biggest practical driver is offline functionality,&#8221; states Hsiao.\n\n\n\nHsiao highlights the shift toward on-device intelligence, particularly in field services, where the workflow must continue regardless of signal strength.\n\n\n\n&#8220;A technician can photograph a faulty part, error code, or serial number while offline. Then an on-device LLM can then identify the asset or error, and provide guided troubleshooting steps from a cached knowledge base instantly,&#8221; explains Hsiao.\n\n\n\nData synchronisation happens automatically once connectivity returns. &#8220;Once a connection is restored, the system handles the &#8216;heavy lifting&#8217; of syncing that data back to the cloud to maintain a single source of truth. This ensures that work gets done, even in the most disconnected environments.&#8221;\n\n\n\nHsiao expects continued innovation in edge AI due to benefits like &#8220;ultra-low latency, enhanced privacy and data security, energy efficiency, and cost savings.&#8221;\n\n\n\nHigh-stakes gateways\n\n\n\nAutonomous agents are not set-and-forget tools. When scaling enterprise AI deployments, governance requires defining exactly when a human must verify an action. Hsiao describes this not as dependency, but as &#8220;architecting for accountability and continuous learning.&#8221;\n\n\n\nSalesforce mandates a &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; for specific areas Hsiao calls &#8220;high-stakes gateways&#8221;:\n\n\n\n&#8220;This includes specific action categories, including any ‘CUD’ (Creating, Uploading, or Deleting) actions, as well as verified contact and customer contact actions,” says Hsiao. “We also default to human confirmation for critical decision-making or any action that could be potentially exploited through prompt manipulation.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThis structure creates a feedback loop where &#8220;agents learn from human expertise,&#8221; creating a system of &#8220;collaborative intelligence&#8221; rather than unchecked automation.\n\n\n\nTrusting an agent requires seeing its work. Salesforce has built a &#8220;Session Tracing Data Model (STDM)&#8221; to provide this visibility. It captures &#8220;turn-by-turn logs&#8221; that offer granular insight into the agent&#8217;s logic.\n\n\n\n&#8220;This gives us granular step-by-step visibility that captures every interaction including user questions, planner steps, tool calls, inputs/outputs, retrieved chunks, responses, timing, and errors,&#8221; says Hsiao.\n\n\n\nThis data allows organisations to run ‘Agent Analytics’ for adoption metrics, ‘Agent Optimisation’ to drill down into performance, and ‘Health Monitoring’ for uptime and latency tracking.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Agentforce observability is the single mission control for all your Agentforce agents for unified visibility, monitoring, and optimisation,” Hsiao summarises.\n\n\n\nStandardising agent communication\n\n\n\nAs businesses deploy agents from different vendors, these systems need a shared protocol to collaborate. &#8220;For multi-agent orchestration to work, agents can’t exist in a vacuum; they need common language,&#8221; argues Hsiao.\n\n\n\nHsiao outlines two layers of standardisation: orchestration and meaning. For orchestration, Salesforce is adopting open-source standards like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent to Agent Protocol).”\n\n\n\n&#8220;We believe open source standards are non-negotiable; they prevent vendor lock-in, enable interoperability, and accelerate innovation.&#8221;\n\n\n\nHowever, communication is useless if the agents interpret data differently. To solve for fragmented data, Salesforce co-founded OSI (Open Semantic Interchange) to unify semantics so an agent in one system &#8220;truly understands the intent of an agent in another.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe future enterprise AI scaling bottleneck: agent-ready data\n\n\n\nLooking forward, the challenge will shift from model capability to data accessibility. Many organisations still struggle with legacy, fragmented infrastructure where &#8220;searchability and reusability&#8221; remain difficult.\n\n\n\nHsiao predicts the next major hurdle – and solution – will be making enterprise data &#8220;‘agent-ready’ through searchable, context-aware architectures that replace traditional, rigid ETL pipelines.&#8221; This shift is necessary to enable &#8220;hyper-personalised and transformed user experience because agents can always access the right context.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;Ultimately, the next year isn’t about the race for bigger, newer models; it’s about building the orchestration and data infrastructure that allows production-grade agentic systems to thrive,” Hsiao concludes.\n\n\n\nSalesforce is a key sponsor of this year’s AI &amp; Big Data Global in London and will have a range of speakers, including Franny Hsiao, sharing their insights during the event.

While generative AI prototypes are easy to spin up, turning them into reliable business assets involves solving the difficult problems of data engineering and governance.</p>\n<p>Ahead of AI &amp; Big Data Global 2026 in London, Franny Hsiao, EMEA Leader of AI Architects at Salesforce, discussed why so many initiatives hit a wall and how organisations can architect systems that actually survive the real world.</p>\n<p>The ‘pristine island’ problem of scaling enterprise AI</p>\n<p>Most failures stem from the environment in which the AI is built. Pilots frequently begin in controlled settings that create a false sense of security, only to crumble when faced with enterprise scale.</p>\n<p>“The single most common architectural oversight that prevents AI pilots from scaling is the failure to architect a production-grade data infrastructure with built-in end to end governance from the start,” Hsiao explains.</p>\n<p>“Understandably, pilots often start on ‘pristine islands’ – using small, curated datasets and simplified workflows. But this ignores the messy reality of enterprise data: the complex integration, normalisation, and transformation required to handle real-world volume and variability.”</p>\n<p>When companies attempt to scale these island-based pilots without addressing the underlying data mess, the systems break.

      "content": "2026 will see forward-thinking organisations building out their squads of AI agents across roles and functions. But amid the rush, there is another aspect to consider.\n\n\n\nOne of IDC’s enterprise technology predictions for the coming five years, published in October, was fascinating. “By 2030, up to 20% of [global 1000] organisations will have faced lawsuits, substantial fines, and CIO dismissals, due to high-profile disruptions stemming from inadequate controls and governance of AI agents,” the analyst noted.\n\n\n\nHow do you therefore put guardrails in place – and how do you ensure these agents work together and, ultimately, do business together? Patrick Tobler, founder and CEO of blockchain infrastructure platform provider NMKR, is working on a project which aims to solve this – by fusing agentic AI and decentralisation.\n\n\n\nThe Masumi Network, born out of a collaboration between NMKR and Serviceplan Group, launched in late 2024 as a framework-agnostic infrastructure which ‘empowers developers to build autonomous agents that collaborate, monetise services, and maintain verifiable trust.’\n\n\n\n“The core thesis of Masumi is that there’s going to be billions of different AI agents from different companies interacting with each other in the future,” explains Tobler. “The difficult part now is – how do you actually have agents from different companies that can interact with each other and send money to each other as well, across these different companies?”\n\n\n\nTake travel as an example. You want to attend an industry conference, so your hotel booking agent buys a plane ticket from your airline agent. The entire experience and transaction will be seamless – but that implicit trust is required.\n\n\n\n“Masumi is a decentralised network of agents, so it’s not relying on any centralised payment infrastructure,” says Tobler. “Instead, agents are equipped with wallets and can send stablecoins from one agent to another and, because of that, interacting with each other in a completely safe and trustless manner.”\n\n\n\nFor Tobler, having spent in his words ‘a lot of time’ in crypto, he determined that its benefits were being pointed to the wrong place.\n\n\n\n“I think there’s a lot of these problems that we have solved in crypto for humans, and then I came to this conclusion that maybe we’ve been solving them or the wrong target audience,” he explains. “Because for humans, using crypto and wallets and blockchains, all that kind of stuff is extremely difficult; the user experience is not great. But for agents, they don’t care if it’s difficult to use. They just use it, and it’s very native to them.\n\n\n\n“So all these issues that are now arising with agents having to interact with millions, or maybe even billions, of agents in the future – these problems have all already been solved with crypto.”\n\n\n\nTobler is attending AI &amp; Big Data Expo Global as part of Discover Cardano; NMKR started on the Cardano blockchain, while Masumi is built completely on Cardano. He says he is looking forward to speaking with businesses that are ‘hearing a lot about AI but aren’t really using it much besides ChatGPT’.\n\n\n\n“I want to understand from them what they are doing, and then figure out how we can help them,” he says. “That’s most often the thing missing from traditional tech startups.

Here&#8217;s just the most obvious points of what we&#8217;re seeing:Biohub&#8217;s bet is that biology advances fastest when it looks more like a software team than a grant pipeline, with software engineers, AI researchers, and biologists co-building models, tools, and datasets rather than throwing results over the wall in silos. This obviously comes from up top, with their co-CEOs being Mark Zuckerberg (engineer) and Priscilla Chan (doctor/scientist). As Mark says, this pairing of &#8220;frontier AI lab&#8221; and &#8220;frontier biology lab&#8221; will unlock a lot more advances in fundamental biology than possible, enabling us to model humans in silico and treating diseases as &#8220;rare as one&#8221;.&#8220;2026 in AI for Science will look a lot like 2025 in AI for Software Engineering&#8221; &#8212; Kevin Weil, OpenAI&#8217;s new VP for Science,&nbsp;said yesterday. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have spun up dedicated AI for Science divisions in the past 4 months, pursuing both product and research. DeepMind of course has the longest history in Science among the frontier labs.In the last 6 months alone, Periodic Labs ($300M seed, upcoming guest!) is building autonomous, AI&#8209;driven &#8220;science factory&#8221; for materials&#8209;led discovery. Lila Sciences ($350M A) is combining frontier models with robotic labs that generate experimental data across biology, chemistry, and materials science. CuspAI ($100M A, upcoming guest!) is building foundation models that search for novel compounds and industrial materials. In Excelsior Sciences ($95M) is building AI&#8209;guided experimentation that drastically shorten drug&#8209;optimization cycles. Chai Discovery (~$70M) is working on antibody and drug discovery, while Harmonic ($120M C), Axiom ($64M seed) and Math Inc are build math&#8209;native AI systems focused on formal reasoning and verifiable proofs.Sam Altman and Jakub Pachocki have publicly committed to delivering an &#8220;Automated AI Research Intern&#8221; by September THIS YEAR (&#8220;A system that can meaningfully accelerate human researchers, not just chat or code.&#8221; - OpenAI Prism is the starting point), and a &#8220;meaningful, Fully Automated AI Researcher by 2028 (&#8220;A system capable of autonomously delivering on larger research projects &#8212; meaning it could formulate hypotheses, plan experiments, run them, analyze results, and draw conclusions without human hand-holding.&#8221;)As a rule, we try to stay grounded at Latent Space, and veer away from discussing AGI timelines and Superintelligence. But it hard to deny that by 2100, we will likely look back and see applying AI engineering to the hard sciences is one of the most important missions to pursue this century. The stakes for humanity are high across chemistry, materials science, high performance computing/chip design, the biology/ pharmaceuticals complex, and even physics, mathematics, and climate science, not to mention AI research accelerating itself. And of course it will be both financially rewarding and impactful.None of this is new. Pushing scientific frontiers has always been important, and yet, to paraphrase Jeff Hammerbacher, the best human minds and LLMs of our generation continue to be directed towards astroturfing Reddit, promote a fork of a fork of a VSCode extension, and generally serving slop. That&#8217;s fine, and slop is a natural part of a well rounded diet, but we see very rewarding opportunities to raise the aspirations of AI Engineers and show them why the general skillset of AI and ML Engineering can actually transfer across to the hard sciences even if the total sum of biology knowledge you have is &#8220;the Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell&#8221;:Standard Knowledge Worker Benchmarks are saturated. We&#8217;re tired of every AI lab taking turns incrementing SWE-Bench Verified or MMLU by 0.1% and claiming SOTA. We know that GPT 5.2 Pro can do ~70% of expert level white collar work. The remaining, &#8220;final frontier&#8221; to hillclimb is on hard sciences like FrontierMath and HLE, our last gasp before discovering new science altogether.Hard Domains are getting Bitter Lessoned: Everything is converging on transformers and multimodal foundation models, even non-mathematicians can get IMO Gold medals because generalist ML &gt; domain expertise.AI solves JIT Self Education: Bloom&#8217;s 2 Sigma Problem ensures that LLMs can help you quickly ramp up on at least baseline common knowledge2 teach yourself what you need to know to interface with domain experts/enable them to do with your skillset what they can&#8217;t do on your own.What a time to be alive: Even if you are perfectly content in your B2B SaaS or Koding Agent job, it is still an incredible privilege to be alive while all this other progress is ongoing in adjacent fields.
