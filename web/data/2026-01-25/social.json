This is the first time I’ve seen it be able to one-shot table segmentation over complex Excel sheets.</p>\n<p>Turns out, scaling reasoning + code generation + adding good Excel tools makes for a really nice Excel agent.</p>\n<p>However: it does use quite a bit of time, tokens, and prompting to be able to codify repetitive Excel workflows at scale. Ify you’re looking to do batch parsing of Excel in a “headless” manner, come check out our very own LlamaSheets!</p>\n<p>It’s API ready and integrates super well with Claude Code + your favorite tools.</p>\n<p>Get started: https://t.co/BM4umyaUzY</p>\n<p>Coding agent guide: https://t.co/6hCnEuWF9j</p>\n<p>Sign up here: https://t.co/XYZmx5TFz8</p>"

      "content": "@dionizije_fa @wholemars When Instagram was purchased for $1 billion it had zero sales, zero profits (huge losses actually), only 14 employees, no assets. \n\nYet today it would be worth hundreds of billions. \n\nI never look at what companies did last quarter (the numbers this last quarter sucked, which is why I see a possible disaster coming). \n\nI look at how relevant a company is. \n\nAnd I've studied its American (and Chinese) competitors and I see Tesla is gaining in relevance, not losing it.\n\nI also don't play short term games. I never can figure those out, since owning Tesla it has gone down something like nine times more than 40%. \n\nI bet on companies that I want to own for at least a decade and this is at the top of my list of those. \n\nIn 1999 Amazon was $112.\nIn 2001 it went down to $6. \n\nBuying and holding at either price looks like a genius move today. \n\nI'll just hold through any moves, either negative or positive. \n\nPlaying other games is valid. Everyone is a different investor. I'm one of those who buys and holds. The past few years that has hurt me. Others sold their Tesla and played other games and made a lot more money than I did. \n\nOne of my things that I do when investing is \"what kind of world do I want to see happen?\"\n\nCars killed two of my high school friends. Autonomy will fix that. Part of my thesis is understanding the auto industry and seeing no one else invested in making that happen. \n\nSomeday that will pay off and if it doesn't, at least I see a ton of Teslas here in Silicon Valley so the future got better than the one I grew up in. Our roads are already safer, even for those who drive gas cars because of Tesla. \n\nThat's worth investing in for me.",

I never can figure those out, since owning Tesla it has gone down something like nine times more than 40%.</p>\n<p>I bet on companies that I want to own for at least a decade and this is at the top of my list of those.</p>\n<p>In 1999 Amazon was $112.</p>\n<p>In 2001 it went down to $6.</p>\n<p>Buying and holding at either price looks like a genius move today.</p>\n<p>I'll just hold through any moves, either negative or positive.</p>\n<p>Playing other games is valid. Everyone is a different investor. I'm one of those who buys and holds. The past few years that has hurt me. Others sold their Tesla and played other games and made a lot more money than I did.</p>\n<p>One of my things that I do when investing is \"what kind of world do I want to see happen?\"</p>\n<p>Cars killed two of my high school friends. Autonomy will fix that. Part of my thesis is understanding the auto industry and seeing no one else invested in making that happen.</p>\n<p>Someday that will pay off and if it doesn't, at least I see a ton of Teslas here in Silicon Valley so the future got better than the one I grew up in. Our roads are already safer, even for those who drive gas cars because of Tesla.</p>\n<p>That's worth investing in for me.</p>"
