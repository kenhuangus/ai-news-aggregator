Moreover, you may be doing so just weeks after the outbreak starts, rather than waiting months or years for drug-approval processes to play out.

      "content": "As the possibility of ASI moves out of kooky thought experiments and into Q4 projections, mainstream animal welfare folks are showing increasing interest in the implications of ASI for animals and on animal welfare in the long-run future.Some animal welfare people seem keen on convincing the AI safety community to care about animal-welfare focused AI safety. I think this is mostly a misunderstanding: the AI safety community is the ASI-pilled/longtermist animal welfare community. The old-school AI safety folks are way more into weird bullet-biting than the animal welfare people, and I can't think of a single one who would think that conscious and sentient beings should be tortured or who would fail to engage seriously with the question of whether or not nonhuman animals are conscious or sentient beings.[1]I think animal welfare people are rightly accustomed to being in environments where nobody is seriously thinking about nonhuman animals, and so concern about animals is very neglected and important to focus on. But in my experience, the AI safety community has quite nuanced views on animal welfare, contains many people who have done significant animal welfare work, and has more developed thoughts on the implications of ASI for the future of animals than the animal welfare community.

Neuroscientists use them to study the brain, ravers love to dance on them, shamans take them to communicate with spirits (or so they say).But psychedelics also help against one of the world’s most painful conditions — cluster headaches. Cluster headaches usually strike on one side of the head, typically around the eye and temple, and last between 15 minutes and 3 hours, often generating intense and disabling pain. They tend to cluster in an 8-10 week period every year, during which patients get multiple attacks per day — hence the name. About 1 in every 2000 people at any given point suffers from this condition.One psychedelic in particular, DMT, aborts a cluster headache near-instantly — when vaporised, it enters the bloodstream in seconds. DMT also works in “sub-psychonautic” doses — doses that cause little-to-no perceptual distortions. Other psychedelics, like LSD and psilocybin, are also effective, but they have to be taken orally and so they work on a scale of 30+ minutes.This post is about the condition, using psychedelics to treat it, and ClusterFree — a new initiative of the Qualia Research Institute to expand legal access to psychedelics for the millions of cluster headache patients worldwide.Cluster headaches are really fucking badIf you’ve been on the internet long enough, you’ve probably seen memes like the one above.
