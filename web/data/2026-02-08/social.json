Ask most VLMs, even though tuned to chart understanding, to parse a line chart to a table and they will struggle.\n\nWe tested over a few samples. Docling’s new granite-vision model, gemini 3 flash, gpt 5.2 pro, and a v0.1 of our own chart parsing (which is in beta and rapidly evolving).\n\nOut of these, most models fail, and sometimes miss the entire chart correctly. gpt 5.2 pro is closest but spends an absurd number of tokens reasoning through each point.

Ask most VLMs, even though tuned to chart understanding, to parse a line chart to a table and they will struggle.</p>\n<p>We tested over a few samples. Docling’s new granite-vision model, gemini 3 flash, gpt 5.2 pro, and a v0.1 of our own chart parsing (which is in beta and rapidly evolving).</p>\n<p>Out of these, most models fail, and sometimes miss the entire chart correctly. gpt 5.2 pro is closest but spends an absurd number of tokens reasoning through each point. Our own parsing is actually quite good, though of course, there’s still some things we need to do to get to 100% accuracy.</p>\n<p>If you want to parse complex documents with diagrams/charts, come check out LlamaCloud! https://t.co/XYZmx5TFz8</p>"

I remember the very first time that I encountered machine learning. This was 20+ years ago, and that was already after 20+ years of being drenched in advanced mathematics as an astrophysicist. \n\nThat first encounter of mine with ML was this definition: \"Machine learning is the set of mathematical algorithms that learn from experience\" (slightly paraphrased from the original quote by Tom Mitchell, CMU). That definition surprised me, confused me, motivated me, and changed the course of my career from astrophysics into AI+DSML. \n\nThis book by Tivadar Danka captures the full meaning of that definition. The book covers thoroughly the many areas and domains of mathematics through which patterns in data are detected, described, learned, and recognized - all for the benefit of powering ML and AI algorithms, applications, and aspirations. \n\nThis book will motivate you, surprise you, and inspire you in many ways, no matter what level of mathematics has (or has not) already propelled your career journey. There is room for all of us to grow. \n\nThis is a great book, worthy to sit on everyone's desktop, ready to help you explore and exploit the full set of mathematical algorithms that learn from experience. \n\nThe book is accompanied by a rich GitHub code repository of Jupyter notebooks. Learn by doing! Do by learning!\n\nDisclosure: the publisher provided me with a free review copy of the book.",

I remember the very first time that I encountered machine learning. This was 20+ years ago, and that was already after 20+ years of being drenched in advanced mathematics as an astrophysicist.</p>\n<p>That first encounter of mine with ML was this definition: \"Machine learning is the set of mathematical algorithms that learn from experience\" (slightly paraphrased from the original quote by Tom Mitchell, CMU). That definition surprised me, confused me, motivated me, and changed the course of my career from astrophysics into AI+DSML.</p>\n<p>This book by Tivadar Danka captures the full meaning of that definition. The book covers thoroughly the many areas and domains of mathematics through which patterns in data are detected, described, learned, and recognized - all for the benefit of powering ML and AI algorithms, applications, and aspirations.</p>\n<p>This book will motivate you, surprise you, and inspire you in many ways, no matter what level of mathematics has (or has not) already propelled your career journey. There is room for all of us to grow.</p>\n<p>This is a great book, worthy to sit on everyone's desktop, ready to help you explore and exploit the full set of mathematical algorithms that learn from experience.</p>\n<p>The book is accompanied by a rich GitHub code repository of Jupyter notebooks. Learn by doing! Do by learning!</p>\n<p>Disclosure: the publisher provided me with a free review copy of the book.</p>"
