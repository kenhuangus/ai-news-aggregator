      "content": "Software development is undergoing a renaissance in front of our eyes.\n\nIf you haven't used the tools recently, you likely are underestimating what you're missing. Since December, there's been a step function improvement in what tools like Codex can do. Some great engineers at OpenAI yesterday told me that their job has fundamentally changed since December. Prior to then, they could use Codex for unit tests; now it writes essentially all the code and does a great deal of their operations and debugging. Not everyone has yet made that leap, but it's usually because of factors besides the capability of the model.\n\nEvery company faces the same opportunity now, and navigating it well — just like with cloud computing or the Internet — requires careful thought. This post shares how OpenAI is currently approaching retooling our teams towards agentic software development. We're still learning and iterating, but here's how we're thinking about it right now:\n\nAs a first step, by March 31st, we're aiming that:\n\n(1) For any technical task, the tool of first resort for humans is interacting with an agent rather than using an editor or terminal.\n(2) The default way humans utilize agents is explicitly evaluated as safe, but also productive enough that most workflows do not need additional permissions.\n\nIn order to get there, here's what we recommended to the team a few weeks ago:\n\n1. Take the time to try out the tools. The tools do sell themselves — many people have had amazing experiences with 5.2 in Codex, after having churned from codex web a few months ago. But many people are also so busy they haven't had a chance to try Codex yet or got stuck thinking \"is there any way it could do X\" rather than just trying.\n  - Designate an \"agents captain\" for your team — the primary person responsible for thinking about how agents can be brought into the teams' workflow.\n  - Share experiences or questions in a few designated internal channels\n  - Take a day for a company-wide Codex hackathon\n\n2. Create skills and AGENTS[.md].\n  - Create and maintain an AGENTS[.md] for any project you work on; update the AGENTS[.md] whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles with a task.\n  - Write skills for anything that you get Codex to do, and commit it to the skills directory in a shared repository\n\n3. Inventory and make accessible any internal tools.\n  - Maintain a list of tools that your team relies on, and make sure someone takes point on making it agent-accessible (such as via a CLI or MCP server).\n\n4. Structure codebases to be agent-first. With the models changing so fast, this is still somewhat untrodden ground, and will require some exploration.\n  - Write tests which are quick to run, and create high-quality interfaces between components.\n\n5. Say no to slop. Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high\n  - Ensure that some human is accountable for any code that gets merged. As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code, and make sure the author understands what they're submitting.\n\n6. Work on basic infra. There's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, which can be guided by internal user feedback. The core tools are getting a lot better and more usable, but there's a lot of infrastructure that currently go around the tools, such as observability, tracking not just the committed code but the agent trajectories that led to them, and central management of the tools that agents are able to use.\n\nOverall, adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out. We encourage every manager to drive this with their team, and to think through other action items — for example, per item 5 above, what else can prevent a lot of \"functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable code\" from creeping into codebases.",

Take translators. Translation can be 100% automated with AI, and this capability has been around since 2023. So we have 2-3 years of data.\n\nWhat we see so far:\n\n- Stable FTE count, but slow hiring or no hiring\n- Nature of the job switched from doing it yourself to supervising AI output (post-editing)\n- Increased task volume\n- Decreased hourly rates\n- Freelancers getting cut\n\nWe are now starting to see the same pattern with software jobs.\n\nOverall there's definitely some pressure on employment but we're very far from \"the jobs just go away\". In fact the number of full-time translators is still modestly increasing.\n\nWhen the economy rebounds from the ongoing \"stealth recession\" and companies start hiring again, the world will have more professional software engineers than we did before GenAI.\n\nThe mass layoffs you're about to see in the tech sector won't be caused by job automation. They will be caused by fears about the economy, like in 2022. It won't be unrelated to AI, mind you, since it ties into big tech capex needs. But it won't be due to automation.",

      "content_html": "<p>What happens when a skill can be almost fully automated with AI? Do these jobs simply disappear?</p>\n<p>Instead of purely speculating we can simply look at concrete examples. Take translators. Translation can be 100% automated with AI, and this capability has been around since 2023. So we have 2-3 years of data.</p>\n<p>What we see so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stable FTE count, but slow hiring or no hiring</li>\n<li>Nature of the job switched from doing it yourself to supervising AI output (post-editing)</li>\n<li>Increased task volume</li>\n<li>Decreased hourly rates</li>\n<li>Freelancers getting cut</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are now starting to see the same pattern with software jobs.</p>\n<p>Overall there's definitely some pressure on employment but we're very far from \"the jobs just go away\". In fact the number of full-time translators is still modestly increasing.</p>\n<p>When the economy rebounds from the ongoing \"stealth recession\" and companies start hiring again, the world will have more professional software engineers than we did before GenAI.</p>\n<p>The mass layoffs you're about to see in the tech sector won't be caused by job automation. They will be caused by fears about the economy, like in 2022. It won't be unrelated to AI, mind you, since it ties into big tech capex needs. But it won't be due to automation.</p>"

He's buying a lot of data from these people as well, but the 12,000 workers at Fremont are an under-thought-of resource.</p>\n<p>He could lend a Tesla robot to each one of those workers to take home. The worker could teach it how to:</p>\n<p>1. Cook food</p>\n<p>2. Wash dishes</p>\n<p>3. Fold and do the laundry</p>\n<p>4. Run their machines</p>\n<p>5. Perform other household tasks</p>\n<p>Then, during the day, they could teach it how to do their job on the factory floor. This manipulation data from dual use would be very important.</p>\n<p>The 12,000 workers at the Fremont factory are not your average, everyday American white boys; they're from all over the world. When I toured the factory, I met people from Mexico, Japan, Germany, China, Korea, Africa, India, and all over the world.</p>\n<p>By lending a robot to them to take home, the robot would learn the culture and layout of their homes in a way that https://t.co/trvepZ1LFT just is not going to be able to match (and probably nobody else in America can).
