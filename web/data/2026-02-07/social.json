Create skills and AGENTS[.md].\n  - Create and maintain an AGENTS[.md] for any project you work on; update the AGENTS[.md] whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles with a task.\n  - Write skills for anything that you get Codex to do, and commit it to the skills directory in a shared repository\n\n3. Inventory and make accessible any internal tools.\n  - Maintain a list of tools that your team relies on, and make sure someone takes point on making it agent-accessible (such as via a CLI or MCP server).\n\n4.

With the models changing so fast, this is still somewhat untrodden ground, and will require some exploration.\n  - Write tests which are quick to run, and create high-quality interfaces between components.\n\n5. Say no to slop. Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high\n  - Ensure that some human is accountable for any code that gets merged. As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code, and make sure the author understands what they're submitting.\n\n6. Work on basic infra. There's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, which can be guided by internal user feedback. The core tools are getting a lot better and more usable, but there's a lot of infrastructure that currently go around the tools, such as observability, tracking not just the committed code but the agent trajectories that led to them, and central management of the tools that agents are able to use.\n\nOverall, adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out.

I'm open to this just being skill issue.\n\nE.g. here some of the things I'd be suspicious about:\n- the zoo of torch compile flags can knowingly be abused to get +1% gains but often at the cost of +30min compile time. This is why modded-nanogpt prohibits torch compile kwarg engineering and why I haven't done any in nanochat either. i wouldn't reliably expect the model to notice, consider, or flag this kind of an issue or seek clarification.\n- ns_steps=3 might be a tiny bit of speed, but does the model also volunteer to make sure quality doesn't fall too much?\n- same thing for deleting .float() cast - sure you can remove it and get VRAM/speed gains but it's there for a clear reason (extra precision in the loss function). Removing it means you absolutely have to make sure that the lower precision is ok validation loss wise, in a highly controlled experiment.\n\nOverall I'm still struggling with getting the models to do significantly more basic things. For example, Opus keeps incorrectly \"cleaning up\" my comments when it doesn't understand them even when it's completely unrelated to the task, rude! It keeps violating and ignoring CLAUDE .md instructions on coding style but when I ask, it correctly points out all the violations. I know, I'm supposed to be using some kind of a /cleanup. Yesterday it gave me a table of results and incorrectly reported which experiment worked best (the table showed xyz=20 was best and it incorrectly claimed that xyz=12 was). Basically - much simpler things still fail routinely than something open-ended like \"improve nanochat\". (I've been doing a lot of YELLING IN UPPER CASE and I think this could actually be a really good metric for A/B testing instead of the inline survey thing.). Still incredibly net useful with oversight and with clear, well-scoped tasks.\n\nI definitely haven't given up on automatic closed-loop experiments with the models. It would be so glorious.

This is why modded-nanogpt prohibits torch compile kwarg engineering and why I haven't done any in nanochat either. i wouldn't reliably expect the model to notice, consider, or flag this kind of an issue or seek clarification.</li>\n<li>ns_steps=3 might be a tiny bit of speed, but does the model also volunteer to make sure quality doesn't fall too much?</li>\n<li>same thing for deleting .float() cast - sure you can remove it and get VRAM/speed gains but it's there for a clear reason (extra precision in the loss function). Removing it means you absolutely have to make sure that the lower precision is ok validation loss wise, in a highly controlled experiment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I'm still struggling with getting the models to do significantly more basic things. For example, Opus keeps incorrectly \"cleaning up\" my comments when it doesn't understand them even when it's completely unrelated to the task, rude! It keeps violating and ignoring CLAUDE .md instructions on coding style but when I ask, it correctly points out all the violations. I know, I'm supposed to be using some kind of a /cleanup. Yesterday it gave me a table of results and incorrectly reported which experiment worked best (the table showed xyz=20 was best and it incorrectly claimed that xyz=12 was). Basically - much simpler things still fail routinely than something open-ended like \"improve nanochat\". (I've been doing a lot of YELLING IN UPPER CASE and I think this could actually be a really good metric for A/B testing instead of the inline survey thing.). Still incredibly net useful with oversight and with clear, well-scoped tasks.</p>\n<p>I definitely haven't given up on automatic closed-loop experiments with the models. It would be so glorious. I had 2 iterations that basically didn't work but I have ideas for the 3rd.</p>"

Just came out of a packed church.\n\nHow can we accelerate?\n\nTake everyone you can into a @waymo, @zoox, or @tesla, or one of the Chinese brands that are pushing autonomous vehicles forward.\n\nI have a list of everyone working in autonomous vehicles. Will post that in comments.\n\nIt is so sad. And to anyone who holds back autonomous vehicles, this is what you doom others to repeat. \n\nI heard the excuses, the resistance to change, did the consumer research.

Today am at an unplanned funeral.</p>\n<p>I met Michael McCallister a few times because he was my son’s friend and roommate’s dad. He crossed a double yellow line into a head on collision. Something an AI driven car doesn’t do. And everyone building AI for vehicles knows they will lead to a day where funerals will get rarer and rarer.</p>\n<p>So sad. The day when funerals don’t happen because of vehicle deaths is long away.</p>\n<p>1.2 million a year world wide.</p>\n<p>Autonomous cars are only used by a few million today.</p>\n<p>If we can speed up the adoption of them even a tiny bit we can save many lives.</p>\n<p>I shot this video to show how many people are affected by just one death. Just came out of a packed church.</p>\n<p>How can we accelerate?</p>\n<p>Take everyone you can into a @waymo, @zoox, or @tesla, or one of the Chinese brands that are pushing autonomous vehicles forward.</p>\n<p>I have a list of everyone working in autonomous vehicles. Will post that in comments.</p>\n<p>It is so sad. And to anyone who holds back autonomous vehicles, this is what you doom others to repeat.</p>\n<p>I heard the excuses, the resistance to change, did the consumer research. I saw the industries that resisted. For decades.</p>\n<p>It will take many decades to come, getting eight billion people the technology that exists, but isn’t distributed to most yet. Many more days like this to come and that breaks my heart.</p>\n<p>We can fix this.</p>"
