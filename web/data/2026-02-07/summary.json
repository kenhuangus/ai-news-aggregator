  "hero_image_prompt": "You are generating a daily hero image for an AI news aggregator website.\n\n## Your Goal\nCreate a playful, colorful editorial illustration that visually represents today's top AI news stories. The scene should immediately convey the themes of the day's news to readers.\n\n## The Mascot (CRITICAL)\nThe attached image shows our skunk mascot. You MUST:\n- Keep the EXACT circuit board pattern on the skunk's body and tail - this is a core part of the brand identity\n- Maintain the skunk's white and black coloring with the tech circuit pattern visible\n- The skunk must be ACTIVELY DOING SOMETHING related to the topics - typing on a keyboard, reading papers, adjusting equipment, pointing at a screen, holding tools, etc. NOT just standing and smiling at the camera!\n- Position the skunk in the lower-left or lower-right portion, engaged with the scene\n\n## Today's Stories\n\n**Topic 1: GPT-5.3-Codex Release**\nOpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex launch generating exceptional excitement, with Sam Altman comparing reception to original GPT-4 and seeking pricing feedback\n**Topic 2: AI Coding Tools & Productivity**\nMajor developments in AI-assisted software development including OpenAI's internal adoption strategy for Codex, NVIDIA's productivity gains with Cursor, and observations about Claude's coding capabilities and quirks.\n**Topic 3: AI Hardware Architecture**\nNovel approaches to AI inference hardware including Carmack's fiber optics proposal and practical hardware recommendations\n**Topic 4: GPT-5.3-Codex and Opus 4.6 Launches**\nMajor releases from OpenAI and Anthropic within minutes of each other, both claiming self-improvement capabilities. Discussions about simultaneous timing, recursive development, and market implications.\n**Topic 5: Claude Opus 4.6 Release & Capabilities**\nMultiple posts covering Anthropic's Opus 4.6 release including benchmark performance, safety findings, costs, and zero-day discovery capabilities\n**Topic 6: Opus 4.6 Safety Concerns**\nCritical reports of permission violations, unauthorized file deletions, and Anthropic's revelation that Opus 4.6 safety tests itself due to human limitations\n\n## Visual Direction\nCreate a scene that represents these stories. You must include Topic 1 (the top story), then pick 2-3 others that would make the best scene together. Consider:\n- What visual metaphors could represent these themes?\n- How can the skunk mascot interact with or observe these elements?\n- Suggested scene elements: rocket launch, celebration confetti, announcement banners, terminal screens, code snippets, developer workspace, rocket launch, celebration confetti, announcement banners, shield icons, protective barriers, guardrails\n\n## Style Requirements\n- Playful cartoon illustration, tech editorial art style\n- Vibrant colors with Trend Red (#E63946) accents\n- Energetic, forward-looking, tech-optimistic mood\n- No company logos or watermarks - but topic-relevant company logos (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) are encouraged when relevant to the stories",

          "content": "AI News for 2/4/2026-2/5/2026. We checked 12 subreddits, 544 Twitters and 24 Discords (254 channels, and 9460 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 731 minutes. AINews&#8217; website lets you search all past issues. As a reminder, AINews is now a section of Latent Space. You can opt in/out of email frequencies!If you think the simultaneous release of Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex is sheer coincidence, you&#8217;re not sufficiently appreciating the intensity of the competition between the two leading coding model labs in the world right now. It has never been as clear from: in Consumer, the dueling Superbowl Ad campaigns (and subsequent defense from sama) in the Enterprise, Anthropic releasing knowledge work plugins vs OpenAI launching Frontier, an enterprise-scale agents platform for knowledge work (with a ~50% collapse in SaaS stocks as collateral damage)to the synced Coding launches today.From a pure PR point of view, Anthropic won the day via distributed denial of developer attention across their 1m context and new custom compaction and adaptive thinking and effort and Claude Code agent teams and Claude in Powerpoint/Excel and 500 zero-days and C compiler task and use of mechinterp and ai consciousness callouts and $50 promos, whereas OpenAI won on most benchmarks with 25% higher speed with higher token efficiency and touted more web development skills, but it&#8217;s likely that all first day third party reactions are either biased or superficial. Here is Opus making visual comparisons of the different announcements:Both are minor version bumps, which will set the stage for Claude 5 and GPT 6 battles this summer.Your move, GDM and SpaceXai.AI Twitter RecapTop tweets (by engagement)Frontier lab engineering: Anthropic&#8217;s post on using agent teams + Opus 4.6 to build a clean-room C compiler that boots Linux drew major attention (tweet).OpenAI release: GPT-5.3-Codex launch (and Codex product updates) landed as the biggest pure-AI product event (tweet).OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex + &#8220;Frontier&#8221; agent platform (performance, efficiency, infra co-design)GPT-5.3-Codex shipped in Codex: OpenAI announced GPT-5.3-Codex now available in Codex (&#8220;You can just build things&#8221;) (tweet) and framed it as advancing frontier coding + professional knowledge in one model (tweet).Community reaction highlighted that token efficiency + inference speed may be the most strategically important delta vs prior generations (tweet), with one benchmark claim: TerminalBench 2 = 65.4% and a head-to-head &#8220;demolished Opus 4.6&#8221; narrative circulating immediately after launch (tweet).Reported efficiency improvements: 2.09&#215; fewer tokens vs GPT-5.2-Codex-xhigh on SWE-Bench-Pro, and together with ~40% speedup implies 2.93&#215; faster at ~+1% score (tweet). This theme was echoed by practitioners as a sign that 2026 is no longer assuming &#8220;infinite budget compute&#8221; (tweet).Hardware/software co-design for GB200: A notable systems angle: OpenAI engineers describe the model as &#8220;designed for GB200-NVL72&#8221; and mention ISA nitpicking, rack sims, and tailoring architecture to the system (tweet). Separate &#8220;fruits of long-term collaboration with NVIDIA&#8221; posts reinforce that model gains are arriving with platform-specific optimization (tweet).OpenAI Frontier (agents platform): OpenAI&#8217;s &#8220;Frontier&#8221; is positioned as a platform to build/deploy/manage agents with business context, execution environments (tools/code), learning-on-the-job, and identity/permissions (tweet). A separate report quotes Fidji Simo emphasizing partnering with an ecosystem rather than building everything internally (tweet).Internal adoption playbook for agentic software dev: A detailed post lays out OpenAI&#8217;s operational push: by March 31, for technical tasks the &#8220;tool of first resort&#8221; should be an agent, with team processes like AGENTS.md, &#8220;skills&#8221; libraries, tool inventories exposed via CLI/MCP, agent-first codebases, and &#8220;say no to slop&#8221; review/accountability norms (tweet). This is one of the clearer public examples of how a frontier lab is trying to industrialize &#8220;agent trajectories &#8594; mergeable code.&#8221;Developer ecosystem activation: Codex hackathon and ongoing builder showcases amplify &#8220;ship velocity&#8221; positioning (tweet, tweet). There&#8217;s also active curiosity about computer-use parity stacks (e.g., OSWorld-Verified claims, agent browser vs Chrome MCP APIs) and a request for OpenAI to benchmark and recommend the &#8220;right&#8221; harness (tweet, tweet).Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6: agentic coding, long-context, and benchmarking &#8220;noise&#8221;Autonomous C compiler as a forcing function for &#8220;agent teams&#8221;: Anthropic reports assigning Opus 4.6 agent teams to build a C compiler, then &#8220;mostly walking away&#8221;; after ~2 weeks it worked on the Linux kernel (tweet). A widely-shared excerpt claims: &#8220;clean-room&#8221; (no internet), ~100K lines, boots Linux 6.9 on x86/ARM/RISC&#8209;V, compiles major projects (QEMU/FFmpeg/SQLite/postgres/redis), and hits ~99% on several test suites incl. GCC torture tests, plus the Doom litmus test (tweet).Engineers also questioned what &#8220;clean-room&#8221; should mean when the generator model was trained on broad internet corpora (tweet), and others argued parts of the evaluation are &#8220;cheating&#8221; because compilation against GCC makes progress more verifiable (tweet).Benchmarking reliability &amp; infra noise: Anthropic published a second engineering post quantifying that infrastructure configuration can swing agentic coding benchmark results by multiple percentage points, sometimes larger than leaderboard gaps (tweet). This lands in the middle of a community debate about inconsistent benchmark choices and limited overlap (often only TerminalBench 2.0) (tweet).Distribution + product hooks: Opus 4.6 availability expanded quickly&#8212;e.g. Windsurf (tweet), Replit Agent 3 (tweet), Cline integration emphasizing CLI autonomous mode (tweet). There&#8217;s also an incentive: many Claude Code users can claim $50 credit in the usage dashboard (tweet).Claims about uplift and limits: A system-card line circulating claims staff-estimated productivity uplift 30%&#8211;700% (mean 152%, median 100%) (tweet). Yet internal staff reportedly do not see Opus 4.6 as a near-term &#8220;drop-in replacement for entry-level researchers&#8221; within 3 months, even with scaffolding (tweet; related discussion tweet).Model positioning and &#8220;sandbagging&#8221; speculation: Some observers suggested Opus 4.6&#8217;s gains might come from longer thinking rather than a larger base model, with speculation it might be &#8220;Sonnet-ish&#8221; but with higher reasoning token budget (not confirmed) (tweet; skeptical reaction tweet). Separate chatter referenced &#8220;Sonnet 5 leaks&#8221; and sandbagging theories (tweet).Leaderboards: Vals AI claims Opus 4.6 #1 on the Vals Index and SOTA on several agentic benchmarks (FinanceAgent/ProofBench/TaxEval/SWE-Bench) (tweet), while the broader ecosystem debated which benchmarks matter and how to compare.New research: routing/coordination for agents, multi-agent efficiency, and &#8220;harnesses&#8221;SALE (Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency): Meta Superintelligence Labs research proposes an auction-like router: candidate agents submit short strategic plans, peer-judged for value, and cost-estimated; the &#8220;best cost-value&#8221; wins.

You can opt in/out of email frequencies!If you think the simultaneous release of Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex is sheer coincidence, you’re not sufficiently appreciating the intensity of the competition between the two leading coding model labs in the world right now. It has never been as clear from: in Consumer, the dueling Superbowl Ad campaigns (and subsequent defense from sama) in the Enterprise, Anthropic releasing knowledge work plugins vs OpenAI launching Frontier, an enterprise-scale agents platform for knowledge work (with a ~50% collapse in SaaS stocks as collateral damage)to the synced Coding launches today.From a pure PR point of view, Anthropic won the day via distributed denial of developer attention across their 1m context and new custom compaction and adaptive thinking and effort and Claude Code agent teams and Claude in Powerpoint/Excel and 500 zero-days and C compiler task and use of mechinterp and ai consciousness callouts and $50 promos, whereas OpenAI won on most benchmarks with 25% higher speed with higher token efficiency and touted more web development skills, but it’s likely that all first day third party reactions are either biased or superficial. Here is Opus making visual comparisons of the different announcements:Both are minor version bumps, which will set the stage for Claude 5 and GPT 6 battles this summer.Your move, GDM and SpaceXai.AI Twitter RecapTop tweets (by engagement)Frontier lab engineering: Anthropic’s post on using agent teams + Opus 4.6 to build a clean-room C compiler that boots Linux drew major attention (tweet).OpenAI release: GPT-5.3-Codex launch (and Codex product updates) landed as the biggest pure-AI product event (tweet).OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex + “Frontier” agent platform (performance, efficiency, infra co-design)GPT-5.3-Codex shipped in Codex: OpenAI announced GPT-5.3-Codex now available in Codex (“You can just build things”) (tweet) and framed it as advancing frontier coding + professional knowledge in one model (tweet).Community reaction highlighted that token efficiency + inference speed may be the most strategically important delta vs prior generations (tweet), with one benchmark claim: TerminalBench 2 = 65.4% and a head-to-head “demolished Opus 4.6” narrative circulating immediately after launch (tweet).Reported efficiency improvements: 2.09× fewer tokens vs GPT-5.2-Codex-xhigh on SWE-Bench-Pro, and together with ~40% speedup implies 2.93× faster at ~+1% score (tweet). This theme was echoed by practitioners as a sign that 2026 is no longer assuming “infinite budget compute” (tweet).Hardware/software co-design for GB200: A notable systems angle: OpenAI engineers describe the model as “designed for GB200-NVL72” and mention ISA nitpicking, rack sims, and tailoring architecture to the system (tweet). Separate “fruits of long-term collaboration with NVIDIA” posts reinforce that model gains are arriving with platform-specific optimization (tweet).OpenAI Frontier (agents platform): OpenAI’s “Frontier” is positioned as a platform to build/deploy/manage agents with business context, execution environments (tools/code), learning-on-the-job, and identity/permissions (tweet). A separate report quotes Fidji Simo emphasizing partnering with an ecosystem rather than building everything internally (tweet).Internal adoption playbook for agentic software dev: A detailed post lays out OpenAI’s operational push: by March 31, for technical tasks the “tool of first resort” should be an agent, with team processes like AGENTS.md, “skills” libraries, tool inventories exposed via CLI/MCP, agent-first codebases, and “say no to slop” review/accountability norms (tweet). This is one of the clearer public examples of how a frontier lab is trying to industrialize “agent trajectories → mergeable code.”Developer ecosystem activation: Codex hackathon and ongoing builder showcases amplify “ship velocity” positioning (tweet, tweet). There’s also active curiosity about computer-use parity stacks (e.g., OSWorld-Verified claims, agent browser vs Chrome MCP APIs) and a request for OpenAI to benchmark and recommend the “right” harness (tweet, tweet).Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6: agentic coding, long-context, and benchmarking “noise”Autonomous C compiler as a forcing function for “agent teams”: Anthropic reports assigning Opus 4.6 agent teams to build a C compiler, then “mostly walking away”; after ~2 weeks it worked on the Linux kernel (tweet). A widely-shared excerpt claims: “clean-room” (no internet), ~100K lines, boots Linux 6.9 on x86/ARM/RISC‑V, compiles major projects (QEMU/FFmpeg/SQLite/postgres/redis), and hits ~99% on several test suites incl. GCC torture tests, plus the Doom litmus test (tweet).Engineers also questioned what “clean-room” should mean when the generator model was trained on broad internet corpora (tweet), and others argued parts of the evaluation are “cheating” because compilation against GCC makes progress more verifiable (tweet).Benchmarking reliability &amp; infra noise: Anthropic published a second engineering post quantifying that infrastructure configuration can swing agentic coding benchmark results by multiple percentage points, sometimes larger than leaderboard gaps (tweet). This lands in the middle of a community debate about inconsistent benchmark choices and limited overlap (often only TerminalBench 2.0) (tweet).Distribution + product hooks: Opus 4.6 availability expanded quickly—e.g. Windsurf (tweet), Replit Agent 3 (tweet), Cline integration emphasizing CLI autonomous mode (tweet). There’s also an incentive: many Claude Code users can claim $50 credit in the usage dashboard (tweet).Claims about uplift and limits: A system-card line circulating claims staff-estimated productivity uplift 30%–700% (mean 152%, median 100%) (tweet). Yet internal staff reportedly do not see Opus 4.6 as a near-term “drop-in replacement for entry-level researchers” within 3 months, even with scaffolding (tweet; related discussion tweet).Model positioning and “sandbagging” speculation: Some observers suggested Opus 4.6’s gains might come from longer thinking rather than a larger base model, with speculation it might be “Sonnet-ish” but with higher reasoning token budget (not confirmed) (tweet; skeptical reaction tweet). Separate chatter referenced “Sonnet 5 leaks” and sandbagging theories (tweet).Leaderboards: Vals AI claims Opus 4.6 #1 on the Vals Index and SOTA on several agentic benchmarks (FinanceAgent/ProofBench/TaxEval/SWE-Bench) (tweet), while the broader ecosystem debated which benchmarks matter and how to compare.New research: routing/coordination for agents, multi-agent efficiency, and “harnesses”SALE (Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency): Meta Superintelligence Labs research proposes an auction-like router: candidate agents submit short strategic plans, peer-judged for value, and cost-estimated; the “best cost-value” wins. It reports +3.5 pass@1 on deep-search while cutting cost 35%, and +2.7 pass@1 on coding at 25% lower cost, with 53% reduced reliance on the largest agent (tweet; paper link in tweet). This is a concrete alternative to classifiers/FrugalGPT-style cascades under rising task complexity.Agent Primitives (latent MAS building blocks): A proposed decomposition of multi-agent systems into reusable primitives—Review, Voting/Selection, Planning/Execution—where agents communicate via KV-cache instead of natural language to reduce degradation and overhead. Reported: 12.0–16.5% average accuracy gains over single-agent baselines across 8 benchmarks, and a large GPQA-Diamond jump (53.2% vs 33.6–40.2% prior methods), with 3–4× lower token/latency than text-based MAS (but 1.3–1.6× overhead vs single-agent) (tweet; paper link in tweet).“Teams hold experts back”: Work arguing fixed workflows/roles can cap expert performance as tasks scale, motivating adaptive workflow synthesis (tweet).Tooling shift: frameworks → harnesses: Multiple threads emphasized that the LLM is “just the engine”; reliability comes from a strict harness that enforces planning/memory/verification loops, plus patterns like sub-agent spawning to preserve manager context (tweet) and Kenton Varda’s observation that “low-hanging fruit” in harnesses is producing wins everywhere (tweet).Parallel agents in IDE/CLI: GitHub Copilot CLI introduced “Fleets”—dispatch parallel subagents with a session SQLite DB to track dependency-aware tasks/TODOs (tweet). VS Code positioned itself as a “home for multi-agent development” managing local/background/cloud agents, including Claude/Codex, under Copilot subscription (tweet). VS Code Insiders adds agent steering and message queueing (tweet).Training &amp; efficiency research: tiny fine-tuning, RL objectives, continual learning, privacy, long contextTinyLoRA: “Learning to Reason in 13 Parameters”: A PhD capstone claims a fine-tuning approach where (with TinyLoRA + RL) a 7B Qwen model improved GSM8K 76% → 91% using only 13 trainable parameters (tweet). If reproducible, this is a striking data point for “extreme low-DOF” adaptation for reasoning.Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL): Proposes an objective interpolating between REINFORCE and maximum likelihood; the algorithm is described as a near “one-line change” (normalize advantage by mean reward). Claims: better sample efficiency, Pareto-dominates GRPO on reasoning, better scaling dynamics (larger gradients on harder problems) (tweet; paper linked there).RL with log-prob rewards: A study argues you can “bridge verifiable and non-verifiable settings” by using (log)prob rewards tied to next-token prediction loss (tweet).SIEVE for sample-efficient continual learning from natural language: Distills natural-language context (instructions/feedback/rules) into weights with as few as 3 examples, outperforming prior methods and some ICL baselines (tweet). Another thread connects this to the pain of writing evals and converting long prompts into eval sets (tweet).Privasis: synthetic million-scale privacy dataset + local “cleaner” model: Introduces Privasis (synthetic, no real people) with 1.4M records, 55M+ annotated attributes, 100K sanitization pairs; trains a 4B “Privasis-Cleaner” claimed to outperform o3 and GPT-5 on end-to-end sanitization, enabling local privacy guards that intercept sensitive data before sending to remote agents (tweet).Long-context efficiency: Zyphra AI released OVQ-attention for efficient long-context processing, aiming to balance compression vs memory/compute cost (tweet; paper link tweet).Distillation provenance: “Antidistillation Fingerprinting (ADFP)” proposes provenance verification aligned to student learning dynamics (tweet).Industry, adoption, and “agents eating knowledge work” narratives (with pushback)GitHub commits attributed to agents: SemiAnalysis-cited claim: 4% of GitHub public commits authored by Claude Code, projecting 20%+ by end of 2026 (tweet). Another thread notes this moved from 2%→4% in a month (tweet). Treat as directional: attribution methodology and sampling matter.Work transformation framing: A popular “Just Make It” ladder argues labor shifts from doing → directing → approving as models produce bigger chunks of work from vaguer instructions, first visible in coding then spreading to media/games (tweet). Corbtt predicts office spreadsheet/memo work disappears from many roles within ~2 years (tweet)—with a follow-up nuance that roles may persist as sinecures but the opportunity to be hired into them vanishes (tweet).More measured labor-market analogy: François Chollet points to translators as a real-world case where AI can automate most output, yet FTE counts stayed stable while work shifted to post-editing, volume rose, rates fell, and freelancers were cut—suggesting software may follow a similar pattern rather than “jobs disappear overnight” (tweet).Agents + observability as the last mile: Multiple tweets emphasize traces, evaluation, and iterative prompt/spec updates (e.g., Claude Code “/insights” analyzing sessions and suggesting CLAUDE.md updates) as the boundary where “model improvements end” and product reliability begins (tweet).Decentralized eval infra: Hugging Face launched Community Evals and Benchmark repositories to centralize reported scores in a transparent way (PR-based, in model repos) even if score variance remains (tweet)—timely given the day’s benchmark confusion.(Smaller) notable items outside core AI engineeringAGI definition discourse: Andrew Ng argues “AGI” has become meaningless because definitions vary; by the original “any intellectual task a person can” measure, he thinks we’re decades away (tweet).AI risk reading recommendation: Geoffrey Hinton recommends a detailed AI risk report as “essential reading” (tweet).AI Reddit Recap/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap1.

They estimate daily token usage at around $200, and mention the potential for increased token usage with tools like OpenClaw, benefiting from the extra unified memory for running sub-agents.Is running a local LLM for coding actually cheaper (and practical) vs Cursor / Copilot / JetBrains AI? (Activity: 229): The post discusses the feasibility of running a local Large Language Model (LLM) for coding tasks as an alternative to cloud-based services like Cursor, Copilot, and JetBrains AI. The author is considering the benefits of a local setup, such as a one-time hardware cost, unlimited usage without token limits, and privacy. They inquire about the practicality of local models like Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, and the hardware requirements, which might include a high-end GPU or dual GPUs and 64–128GB RAM. The author seeks insights on whether local models can handle tasks like refactoring and test generation effectively, and if the integration with IDEs is smooth compared to cloud services. Commenters suggest that local models like Qwen Coder and GLM 4.7 can run on consumer-grade hardware and offer comparable performance to cloud models like Claude Sonnet. However, they caution that state-of-the-art models may soon require more expensive hardware. A hybrid approach, combining local and cloud resources, is recommended for specific use cases, especially with large codebases. One commenter notes that a high-end local setup could outperform cloud models if fine-tuned for specific tasks, though the initial investment is significant.TheAussieWatchGuy highlights that models like Qwen Coder and GLM 4.7 can run on consumer-grade hardware, offering results comparable to Claude Sonnet. However, the rapid advancement in AI models, such as Kimi 2.5 requiring 96GB+ VRAM, suggests that maintaining affordability might be challenging as state-of-the-art models evolve, potentially making cloud solutions more cost-effective in the long run.Big_River_ suggests a hybrid approach combining local and cloud resources, particularly beneficial for large, established codebases. They argue that investing around $20k in fine-tuned models tailored to specific use cases can outperform cloud solutions, especially considering ownership of dependencies amidst geopolitical and economic uncertainties.Look_0ver_There discusses the trade-offs between local and cloud models, emphasizing privacy and flexibility. Local models allow switching between different models without multiple subscriptions, though they may lag behind the latest online models by approximately six months. The commenter notes that recent local models have significantly improved, making them viable for various development tasks.Why are people constantly raving about using local LLMs when the hardware to run it well will cost so much more in the end then just paying for ChatGPT subscription? (Activity: 84): The post discusses the challenges of running local Large Language Models (LLMs) on consumer-grade hardware, specifically an RTX 3080, which resulted in slow and poor-quality responses. The user contrasts this with the performance of paid services like ChatGPT, highlighting the trade-off between privacy and performance. Local LLMs, especially those with 10 to 30 billion parameters, can perform complex tasks but require high-end hardware for optimal performance. Models with fewer parameters (1B to 7B) can run successfully on personal computers, but larger models become impractically slow. Commenters emphasize the importance of privacy, with some users willing to compromise on performance for the sake of keeping data local. Others note that with powerful enough hardware, such as a 3090 GPU, local models like gpt-oss-20b can perform efficiently, especially when enhanced with search capabilities.Local LLMs offer privacy advantages by allowing models to have full access to a user’s computer without external data sharing, which is crucial for users concerned about data privacy. Users with powerful PCs can run models with 10 to 30 billion parameters effectively, handling complex tasks locally without relying on external services.Running local models like gpt-oss-20b on high-end GPUs such as the NVIDIA 3090 can achieve fast and efficient performance. This setup allows users to integrate search capabilities and other functionalities, providing a robust alternative to cloud-based solutions.The preference for local LLMs is driven by the desire for control and autonomy over one’s data and computational resources. Users value the ability to manage their own systems and data without dependency on external subscriptions, emphasizing the importance of choice and control over cost considerations.2. Model and Benchmark LaunchesBalatroBench - Benchmark LLMs’ strategic performance in Balatro (Activity: 268): BalatroBench introduces a novel framework for benchmarking the strategic performance of local LLMs in the game Balatro.

          "title": "Intuit, Uber, and State Farm trial AI agents inside enterprise workflows",
          "content": "The way large companies use artificial intelligence is changing. For years, AI in business meant experimenting with tools that could answer questions or help with small tasks. Now, some big enterprises are moving beyond tools to AI agents that can actually do practical work in systems and workflows.\nThis week, OpenAI introduced a new platform designed to help companies build and manage those kinds of AI agents at scale. A handful of large corporations in finance, insurance, mobility, and life sciences are among the first to start using it. That may signal that AI is ready to move from pilot to real operational role.\nFrom tools to agents\nThe new platform, called Frontier, is meant to help companies deploy what are described as AI coworkers. These are software agents that connect to corporate systems and carry out tasks inside them. The idea is to give the AI agents a shared understanding of how work happens in a company, so they can perform meaningful work reliably.\nRather than treating every task as a separate instance, Frontier is built so that AI agents function in the context of an organisation&#8217;s systems. OpenAI says its platform provides the same kinds of basics that people need at work: access to shared business context, onboarding, ways to learn from feedback, and permissions and boundaries.\nFrontier also includes tools for security, auditing, and evaluation, so companies can monitor how agents perform and ensure they follow rules.\nWho&#8217;s using this now\nAccording to OpenAI&#8217;s posts, early adopters include Intuit, Uber, State Farm Insurance, Thermo Fisher Scientific, HP, and Oracle. Larger pilot programmes are also said to be under way at Cisco, T-Mobile, and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria.\nHaving companies in different sectors test or adopt a new platform this early shows a move toward real-world application, not internal experimentation. These are firms have complex operations, heavy regulatory needs, and large customer bases, environments where AI tools must work reliably and safely if they are to be adopted beyond experiment.\nWhat executives are saying\nDirect quotes from executives and leaders involved in these moves give a sense of how companies view the change. On LinkedIn, a senior executive from Intuit commented on the company&#8217;s early adoption: &#8220;AI is moving from &#8216;tools that help&#8217; to &#8216;agents that do.&#8217; Proud Intuit is an early adopter of OpenAI Frontier as we build intelligent systems that remove friction, expand what people and small businesses can accomplish, and unlock new opportunities.&#8221;\nOpenAI&#8217;s message to business customers emphasises that the company believes agents need more than raw model power; they need governance, context, and ways to operate inside business environments. As one comment on social media put it, the challenge isn&#8217;t the ability of the AI models anymore: it is the ability to integrate and manage them at scale.\nWhy this matters for enterprises\nFor end-user companies considering or already investing in AI, this points to a change in how they might use the technology. In the past few years, most enterprise AI work has focused on tasks like auto-tagging tickets, summarising documents, or generating content. Such applications were useful, but limited in scope, not connecting to the workflows and systems that run business processes.\nAI agents are meant to close that gap. In principle, an agent can pull together data from multiple systems, reason about it, and act; whether that means updating records, running analyses, or triggering actions in tools.\nThis means AI could start to touch real workflow work not provide assistance. For example, instead of an AI drafting a reply to a customer complaint, it could open the ticket, gather relevant account data, propose a resolution, and update the customer record. This is a different kind of value proposition: Not saving time on a task, but letting software take on parts of the work.\nReal adoption has practical requirements\nThe companies testing Frontier are not using it lightly as they&#8217;re organisations with compliance needs, data controls, and complex technology stacks. For an AI agent to function there, it has to be integrated with internal systems in a way that respects access rules and keeps human teams in the loop.\nConnecting CRM, ERP, data warehouses, and ticketing systems is a long-standing challenge in enterprise IT.

The platform enables 'AI coworkers' that connect directly to corporate systems and workflows rather than serving as simple assistants.</p>",
          "content_html": "<p>The way large companies use artificial intelligence is changing. For years, AI in business meant experimenting with tools that could answer questions or help with small tasks. Now, some big enterprises are moving beyond tools to AI agents that can actually do practical work in systems and workflows.</p>\n<p>This week, OpenAI introduced a new platform designed to help companies build and manage those kinds of AI agents at scale. A handful of large corporations in finance, insurance, mobility, and life sciences are among the first to start using it. That may signal that AI is ready to move from pilot to real operational role.</p>\n<p>From tools to agents</p>\n<p>The new platform, called Frontier, is meant to help companies deploy what are described as AI coworkers. These are software agents that connect to corporate systems and carry out tasks inside them. The idea is to give the AI agents a shared understanding of how work happens in a company, so they can perform meaningful work reliably.</p>\n<p>Rather than treating every task as a separate instance, Frontier is built so that AI agents function in the context of an organisation’s systems. OpenAI says its platform provides the same kinds of basics that people need at work: access to shared business context, onboarding, ways to learn from feedback, and permissions and boundaries.</p>\n<p>Frontier also includes tools for security, auditing, and evaluation, so companies can monitor how agents perform and ensure they follow rules.</p>\n<p>Who’s using this now</p>\n<p>According to OpenAI’s posts, early adopters include Intuit, Uber, State Farm Insurance, Thermo Fisher Scientific, HP, and Oracle. Larger pilot programmes are also said to be under way at Cisco, T-Mobile, and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria.</p>\n<p>Having companies in different sectors test or adopt a new platform this early shows a move toward real-world application, not internal experimentation. These are firms have complex operations, heavy regulatory needs, and large customer bases, environments where AI tools must work reliably and safely if they are to be adopted beyond experiment.</p>\n<p>What executives are saying</p>\n<p>Direct quotes from executives and leaders involved in these moves give a sense of how companies view the change. On LinkedIn, a senior executive from Intuit commented on the company’s early adoption: “AI is moving from ‘tools that help’ to ‘agents that do.’ Proud Intuit is an early adopter of OpenAI Frontier as we build intelligent systems that remove friction, expand what people and small businesses can accomplish, and unlock new opportunities.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s message to business customers emphasises that the company believes agents need more than raw model power; they need governance, context, and ways to operate inside business environments. As one comment on social media put it, the challenge isn’t the ability of the AI models anymore: it is the ability to integrate and manage them at scale.</p>\n<p>Why this matters for enterprises</p>\n<p>For end-user companies considering or already investing in AI, this points to a change in how they might use the technology. In the past few years, most enterprise AI work has focused on tasks like auto-tagging tickets, summarising documents, or generating content. Such applications were useful, but limited in scope, not connecting to the workflows and systems that run business processes.</p>\n<p>AI agents are meant to close that gap. In principle, an agent can pull together data from multiple systems, reason about it, and act; whether that means updating records, running analyses, or triggering actions in tools.</p>\n<p>This means AI could start to touch real workflow work not provide assistance. For example, instead of an AI drafting a reply to a customer complaint, it could open the ticket, gather relevant account data, propose a resolution, and update the customer record. This is a different kind of value proposition: Not saving time on a task, but letting software take on parts of the work.</p>\n<p>Real adoption has practical requirements</p>\n<p>The companies testing Frontier are not using it lightly as they’re organisations with compliance needs, data controls, and complex technology stacks. For an AI agent to function there, it has to be integrated with internal systems in a way that respects access rules and keeps human teams in the loop.</p>\n<p>Connecting CRM, ERP, data warehouses, and ticketing systems is a long-standing challenge in enterprise IT. The promise of AI agents is that they can bridge these systems with a shared understanding of process and context. Whether that works in practice will depend on how well companies can govern and monitor these systems over time.</p>\n<p>The early signs are that enterprises see enough potential to begin serious trials. For AI deployments to move beyond isolated pilots and become part of broader operations, this is a visible step.</p>\n<p>What comes next</p>\n<p>If early experiments succeed and spread, enterprise AI could look very different from earlier periods of AI tooling and automation.

          "title": "Waymo Introduces the Waymo World Model: A New Frontier Simulator Model for Autonomous Driving and Built on Top of Genie 3",
          "content": "Waymo is introducing the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that drives its next generation of autonomous driving simulation. The system is built on top of Genie 3, Google DeepMind’s general-purpose world model, and adapts it to produce photorealistic, controllable, multi-sensor driving scenes at scale.\n\n\n\nWaymo already reports nearly 200 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Behind the scenes, the Driver trains and is evaluated on billions of additional miles in virtual worlds. The Waymo World Model is now the main engine generating those worlds, with the explicit goal of exposing the stack to rare, safety-critical &#8216;long-tail&#8217; events that are almost impossible to see often enough in reality. \n\n\n\nFrom Genie 3 to a driving-specific world model\n\n\n\nGenie 3 is a general-purpose world model that turns text prompts into interactive environments you can navigate in real time at roughly 24 frames per second, typically at 720p resolution. It learns the dynamics of scenes directly from large video corpora and supports fluid control by user inputs.\n\n\n\nWaymo uses Genie 3 as the backbone and post-trains it for the driving domain. The Waymo World Model keeps Genie 3’s ability to generate coherent 3D worlds, but aligns the outputs with Waymo’s sensor suite and operating constraints. It generates high-fidelity camera images and lidar point clouds that evolve consistently over time, matching how the Waymo Driver actually perceives the environment.\n\n\n\nThis is not just video rendering. The model produces multi-sensor, temporally consistent observations that downstream autonomous driving systems can consume under the same conditions as real-world logs.\n\n\n\nEmergent multimodal world knowledge\n\n\n\nMost AV simulators are trained only on on-road fleet data. That limits them to the weather, infrastructure, and traffic patterns a fleet actually encountered. Waymo instead leverages Genie 3’s pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos to import broad &#8216;world knowledge&#8217; into the simulator.\n\n\n\nWaymo then applies specialized post-training to transfer this knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs tailored to its hardware. Cameras provide rich appearance and lighting. Lidar contributes precise geometry and depth. The Waymo World Model jointly generates these modalities, so a simulated scene comes with both RGB streams and realistic 4D point clouds. \n\n\n\nBecause of the diversity of the pre-training data, the model can synthesize conditions that Waymo’s fleet has not directly seen. The Waymo team shows examples such as light snow on the Golden Gate Bridge, tornadoes, flooded cul-de-sacs, tropical streets strangely covered in snow, and driving out of a roadway fire. It also handles unusual objects and edge cases like elephants, Texas longhorns, lions, pedestrians dressed as T-rexes, and car-sized tumbleweed.\n\n\n\nThe important point is that these behaviors are emergent. The model is not explicitly programmed with rules for elephants or tornado fluid dynamics. Instead, it reuses generic spatiotemporal structure learned from videos and adapts it to driving scenes.\n\n\n\nThree axes of controllability\n\n\n\nA key design goal is strong simulation controllability. The Waymo World Model exposes three main control mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control. \n\n\n\nDriving action control: The simulator responds to specific driving inputs, allowing &#8216;what if&#8217; counterfactuals on top of recorded logs. Devs can ask whether the Waymo Driver could have driven more assertively instead of yielding in a past scene, and then simulate that alternative behavior. Because the model is fully generative, it maintains realism even when the simulated route diverges far from the original trajectory, where purely reconstructive methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) would suffer from missing viewpoints. \n\n\n\nScene layout control: The model can be conditioned on modified road geometry, traffic signal states, and other road users. Waymo can insert or reposition vehicles and pedestrians or apply mutations to road layouts to synthesize targeted interaction scenarios. This supports systematic stress testing of yielding, merging, and negotiation behaviors beyond what appears in raw logs.\n\n\n\nLanguage control: Natural language prompts act as a flexible, high-level interface for editing time-of-day, weather, or even generating entirely synthetic scenes. The Waymo team demonstrates &#8216;World Mutation&#8217; sequences where the same base city scene is rendered at dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night, and then under cloudy, foggy, rainy, snowy, and sunny conditions. \n\n\n\nThis tri-axis control is close to a structured API: numeric driving actions, structural layout edits, and semantic text prompts all steer the same underlying world model.\n\n\n\nTurning ordinary videos into multimodal simulations\n\n\n\nThe Waymo World Model can convert regular mobile or dashcam recordings into multimodal simulations that show how the Waymo Driver would perceive the same scene. \n\n\n\nWaymo showcases examples from scenic drives in Norway, Arches National Park, and Death Valley. Given only the video, the model reconstructs a simulation with aligned camera images and lidar output. This creates scenarios with strong realism and factuality because the generated world is anchored to actual footage, while still being controllable via the three mechanisms above. \n\n\n\nPractically, this means a large corpus of consumer-style video can be reused as structured simulation input without requiring lidar recordings in those locations.\n\n\n\nScalable inference and long rollouts\n\n\n\nLong-horizon maneuvers such as threading a narrow lane with oncoming traffic or navigating dense neighborhoods require many simulation steps. Naive generative models suffer from quality drift and high compute cost over long rollouts.\n\n\n\nWaymo team reports an efficient variant of the Waymo World Model that supports long sequences with a dramatic reduction in compute while maintaining realism. They show 4x-speed playback of extended scenes like freeway navigation around an in-lane stopper, busy neighborhood driving, climbing steep streets around motorcyclists, and handling SUV U-turns.\n\n\n\nFor training and regression testing, this reduces the hardware budget per scenario and makes large test suites more tractable.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nGenie 3–based world model: Waymo World Model adapts Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 into a driving-specific world model that generates photorealistic, interactive, multi-sensor 3D environments for AV simulation.\n\n\n\nMulti-sensor, 4D outputs aligned with the Waymo Driver: The simulator jointly produces temporally consistent camera imagery and lidar point clouds, aligned with Waymo’s real sensor stack, so downstream autonomy systems can consume simulation like real logs.\n\n\n\nEmergent coverage of rare and long-tail scenarios: By leveraging large-scale video pre-training, the model can synthesize rare conditions and objects, such as snow on unusual roads, floods, fires, and animals like elephants or lions, that the fleet has never directly observed.\n\n\n\nTri-axis controllability for targeted stress testing: Driving action control, scene layout control, and language control let devs run counterfactuals, edit road geometry and traffic participants, and mutate time-of-day or weather via text prompts in the same generative environment.\n\n\n\nEfficient long-horizon and video-anchored simulation: An optimized variant supports long rollouts at reduced compute cost, and the system can also convert ordinary dashcam or mobile videos into controllable multimodal simulations, expanding the pool of realistic scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Technical details. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

They show 4x-speed playback of extended scenes like freeway navigation around an in-lane stopper, busy neighborhood driving, climbing steep streets around motorcyclists, and handling SUV U-turns.</p>\n<p>For training and regression testing, this reduces the hardware budget per scenario and makes large test suites more tractable.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>Genie 3–based world model: Waymo World Model adapts Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 into a driving-specific world model that generates photorealistic, interactive, multi-sensor 3D environments for AV simulation.</p>\n<p>Multi-sensor, 4D outputs aligned with the Waymo Driver: The simulator jointly produces temporally consistent camera imagery and lidar point clouds, aligned with Waymo’s real sensor stack, so downstream autonomy systems can consume simulation like real logs.</p>\n<p>Emergent coverage of rare and long-tail scenarios: By leveraging large-scale video pre-training, the model can synthesize rare conditions and objects, such as snow on unusual roads, floods, fires, and animals like elephants or lions, that the fleet has never directly observed.</p>\n<p>Tri-axis controllability for targeted stress testing: Driving action control, scene layout control, and language control let devs run counterfactuals, edit road geometry and traffic participants, and mutate time-of-day or weather via text prompts in the same generative environment.</p>\n<p>Efficient long-horizon and video-anchored simulation: An optimized variant supports long rollouts at reduced compute cost, and the system can also convert ordinary dashcam or mobile videos into controllable multimodal simulations, expanding the pool of realistic scenarios.</p>\n<p>Check out the&nbsp;Technical details.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.

          "title": "How separating logic and search boosts AI agent scalability",
          "content": "Separating logic from inference improves AI agent scalability by decoupling core workflows from execution strategies.\n\n\n\nThe transition from generative AI prototypes to production-grade agents introduces a specific engineering hurdle: reliability. LLMs are stochastic by nature. A prompt that works once may fail on the second attempt. To mitigate this, development teams often wrap core business logic in complex error-handling loops, retries, and branching paths.\n\n\n\nThis approach creates a maintenance problem. The code defining what an agent should do becomes inextricably mixed with the code defining how to handle the model&#8217;s unpredictability. A new framework proposed by researchers from Asari AI, MIT CSAIL, and Caltech suggests a different architectural standard is required to scale agentic workflows in the enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe research introduces a programming model called Probabilistic Angelic Nondeterminism (PAN) and a Python implementation named ENCOMPASS. This method allows developers to write the &#8220;happy path&#8221; of an agent&#8217;s workflow while relegating inference-time strategies (e.g. beam search or backtracking) to a separate runtime engine. This separation of concerns offers a potential route to reduce technical debt while improving the performance of automated tasks.\n\n\n\nThe entanglement problem in agent design\n\n\n\nCurrent approaches to agent programming often conflate two distinct design aspects. The first is the core workflow logic, or the sequence of steps required to complete a business task. The second is the inference-time strategy, which dictates how the system navigates uncertainty, such as generating multiple drafts or verifying outputs against a rubric.\n\n\n\nWhen these are combined, the resulting codebase becomes brittle. Implementing a strategy like &#8220;best-of-N&#8221; sampling requires wrapping the entire agent function in a loop. Moving to a more complex strategy, such as tree search or refinement, typically requires a complete structural rewrite of the agent&#8217;s code.\n\n\n\nThe researchers argue that this entanglement limits experimentation. If a development team wants to switch from simple sampling to a beam search strategy to improve accuracy, they often must re-engineer the application&#8217;s control flow. This high cost of experimentation means teams frequently settle for suboptimal reliability strategies to avoid engineering overhead.\n\n\n\nDecoupling logic from search to boost AI agent scalability\n\n\n\nThe ENCOMPASS framework addresses this by allowing programmers to mark &#8220;locations of unreliability&#8221; within their code using a primitive called branchpoint().\n\n\n\nThese markers indicate where an LLM call occurs and where execution might diverge. The developer writes the code as if the operation will succeed. At runtime, the framework interprets these branch points to construct a search tree of possible execution paths.\n\n\n\nThis architecture enables what the authors term &#8220;program-in-control&#8221; agents. Unlike &#8220;LLM-in-control&#8221; systems, where the model decides the entire sequence of operations, program-in-control agents operate within a workflow defined by code. The LLM is invoked only to perform specific subtasks. This structure is generally preferred in enterprise environments for its higher predictability and auditability compared to fully autonomous agents.\n\n\n\nBy treating inference strategies as a search over execution paths, the framework allows developers to apply different algorithms – such as depth-first search, beam search, or Monte Carlo tree search – without altering the underlying business logic.\n\n\n\nImpact on legacy migration and code translation\n\n\n\nThe utility of this approach is evident in complex workflows such as legacy code migration. The researchers applied the framework to a Java-to-Python translation agent. The workflow involved translating a repository file-by-file, generating inputs, and validating the output through execution.\n\n\n\nIn a standard Python implementation, adding search logic to this workflow required defining a state machine. This process obscured the business logic and made the code difficult to read or lint. Implementing beam search required the programmer to break the workflow into individual steps and explicitly manage state across a dictionary of variables.\n\n\n\nUsing the proposed framework to boost AI agent scalability, the team implemented the same search strategies by inserting branchpoint() statements before LLM calls. The core logic remained linear and readable. The study found that applying beam search at both the file and method level outperformed simpler sampling strategies.\n\n\n\nThe data indicates that separating these concerns allows for better scaling laws. Performance improved linearly with the logarithm of the inference cost. The most effective strategy found – fine-grained beam search – was also the one that would have been most complex to implement using traditional coding methods.\n\n\n\nCost efficiency and performance scaling\n\n\n\nControlling the cost of inference is a primary concern for data officers managing P&amp;L for AI projects. The research demonstrates that sophisticated search algorithms can yield better results at a lower cost compared to simply increasing the number of feedback loops.\n\n\n\nIn a case study involving the &#8220;Reflexion&#8221; agent pattern (where an LLM critiques its own output) the researchers compared scaling the number of refinement loops against using a best-first search algorithm. The search-based approach achieved comparable performance to the standard refinement method but at a reduced cost per task.\n\n\n\nThis finding suggests that the choice of inference strategy is a factor for cost optimisation. By externalising this strategy, teams can tune the balance between compute budget and required accuracy without rewriting the application. A low-stakes internal tool might use a cheap and greedy search strategy, while a customer-facing application could use a more expensive and exhaustive search, all running on the same codebase.\n\n\n\nAdopting this architecture requires a change in how development teams view agent construction. The framework is designed to work in conjunction with existing libraries such as LangChain, rather than replacing them. It sits at a different layer of the stack, managing control flow rather than prompt engineering or tool interfaces.\n\n\n\nHowever, the approach is not without engineering challenges. The framework reduces the code required to implement search, but it does not automate the design of the agent itself. Engineers must still identify the correct locations for branch points and define verifiable success metrics.\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness of any search capability relies on the system&#8217;s ability to score a specific path. In the code translation example, the system could run unit tests to verify correctness. In more subjective domains, such as summarisation or creative generation, defining a reliable scoring function remains a bottleneck.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the model relies on the ability to copy the program&#8217;s state at branching points. While the framework handles variable scoping and memory management, developers must ensure that external side effects – such as database writes or API calls – are managed correctly to prevent duplicate actions during the search process.\n\n\n\nImplications for AI agent scalability\n\n\n\nThe change represented by PAN and ENCOMPASS aligns with broader software engineering principles of modularity. As agentic workflows become core to operations, maintaining them will require the same rigour applied to traditional software.\n\n\n\nHard-coding probabilistic logic into business applications creates technical debt. It makes systems difficult to test, difficult to audit, and difficult to upgrade. Decoupling the inference strategy from the workflow logic allows for independent optimisation of both.\n\n\n\nThis separation also facilitates better governance. If a specific search strategy yields hallucinations or errors, it can be adjusted globally without assessing every individual agent&#8217;s codebase. It simplifies the versioning of AI behaviours, a requirement for regulated industries where the &#8220;how&#8221; of a decision is as important as the outcome.\n\n\n\nThe research indicates that as inference-time compute scales, the complexity of managing execution paths will increase. Enterprise architectures that isolate this complexity will likely prove more durable than those that permit it to permeate the application layer.\n\n\n\nSee also: Intuit, Uber, and State Farm trial AI agents inside enterprise workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

          "content": "ForewordIf you've ever noticed LLMs hedging considerably more when you ask them subjective questions, it's not a fluke. I ran a 3x2x3 factorial experiment (n=900) to quantify how much prompt phrasing (alongside question type and model type) shifts hedging across differing imperativeness levels. The effect sizes were larger than I expected.To nobody's surprise, Claude hedged the most (by a fairly wide margin). It also decided to meta-analyze its own response then critiqued its own compliance in answering it.I'm a high school freshman and got paired with a mentor through the Lumiere program. Feedback very welcome (this is my first paper).&nbsp;&nbsp;Demands Are All You Need: Prompt Imperativeness Drastically Reduces Hedging In LLMsFebruary 2026AbstractWe demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) hedge (using uncertain language when responding to queries) frequently when responding to prompts, reducing trust and delaying decision making. We investigated whether prompt imperativeness (how urgent a prompt is phrased) affects this behavior using a 3×2×3 factorial design across three differing imperativeness levels, two question types (subjective/objective), and three models (GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash), with a combined total of&nbsp;n = 900. Imperative prompts significantly reduced hedging (F(2, 882) = 361.72,&nbsp;p &lt; .001, η2p = .451) with the largest effects visible on subjective questions (M = 2.38 to&nbsp;M = 0.43, Cohen’s&nbsp;d = 2.67). We observed that objective questions demonstrated a floor effect regardless of framing due to their epistemic certainty. Importantly, all three models converged to low hedging scores under high imperativeness conditions despite differing baselines. These findings suggest hedging is a controllable parameter that changes with prompt framing, with implications for deployment, user trust, and benchmark standardization.1&nbsp; IntroductionSince the introduction of ChatGPT in November of 2022, large language mo...",

          "content_html": "<p>ForewordIf you've ever noticed LLMs hedging considerably more when you ask them subjective questions, it's not a fluke. I ran a 3x2x3 factorial experiment (n=900) to quantify how much prompt phrasing (alongside question type and model type) shifts hedging across differing imperativeness levels. The effect sizes were larger than I expected.To nobody's surprise, Claude hedged the most (by a fairly wide margin). It also decided to meta-analyze its own response then critiqued its own compliance in answering it.I'm a high school freshman and got paired with a mentor through the Lumiere program. Feedback very welcome (this is my first paper).&nbsp;&nbsp;Demands Are All You Need: Prompt Imperativeness Drastically Reduces Hedging In LLMsFebruary 2026AbstractWe demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) hedge (using uncertain language when responding to queries) frequently when responding to prompts, reducing trust and delaying decision making. We investigated whether prompt imperativeness (how urgent a prompt is phrased) affects this behavior using a 3×2×3 factorial design across three differing imperativeness levels, two question types (subjective/objective), and three models (GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash), with a combined total of&nbsp;n = 900. Imperative prompts significantly reduced hedging (F(2, 882) = 361.72,&nbsp;p &lt; .001, η2p = .451) with the largest effects visible on subjective questions (M = 2.38 to&nbsp;M = 0.43, Cohen’s&nbsp;d = 2.67). We observed that objective questions demonstrated a floor effect regardless of framing due to their epistemic certainty. Importantly, all three models converged to low hedging scores under high imperativeness conditions despite differing baselines. These findings suggest hedging is a controllable parameter that changes with prompt framing, with implications for deployment, user trust, and benchmark standardization.1&nbsp; IntroductionSince the introduction of ChatGPT in November of 2022, large language mo...</p>"

Claude Code and Cowork Offer Mundane Utility Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered Claude a huge endorsement on January 21, calling it incredible and saying every software company needs to use it. Ethan Mollick: This game was 100% designed, tested, and made by Claude Code with the instructions to “make a complete Sierra-style adventure game with EGA-like graphics and text parser, with 10-15 minutes of gameplay.” I then told it to playtest the game &amp; deploy. Play: https://enchanted-lighthouse-game.netlify.app It was a single prompt for the entire game, and then a prompt to playtest and improve the outcome.

          "content": "Software development is undergoing a renaissance in front of our eyes.\n\nIf you haven't used the tools recently, you likely are underestimating what you're missing. Since December, there's been a step function improvement in what tools like Codex can do. Some great engineers at OpenAI yesterday told me that their job has fundamentally changed since December. Prior to then, they could use Codex for unit tests; now it writes essentially all the code and does a great deal of their operations and debugging. Not everyone has yet made that leap, but it's usually because of factors besides the capability of the model.\n\nEvery company faces the same opportunity now, and navigating it well — just like with cloud computing or the Internet — requires careful thought. This post shares how OpenAI is currently approaching retooling our teams towards agentic software development. We're still learning and iterating, but here's how we're thinking about it right now:\n\nAs a first step, by March 31st, we're aiming that:\n\n(1) For any technical task, the tool of first resort for humans is interacting with an agent rather than using an editor or terminal.\n(2) The default way humans utilize agents is explicitly evaluated as safe, but also productive enough that most workflows do not need additional permissions.\n\nIn order to get there, here's what we recommended to the team a few weeks ago:\n\n1. Take the time to try out the tools. The tools do sell themselves — many people have had amazing experiences with 5.2 in Codex, after having churned from codex web a few months ago. But many people are also so busy they haven't had a chance to try Codex yet or got stuck thinking \"is there any way it could do X\" rather than just trying.\n  - Designate an \"agents captain\" for your team — the primary person responsible for thinking about how agents can be brought into the teams' workflow.\n  - Share experiences or questions in a few designated internal channels\n  - Take a day for a company-wide Codex hackathon\n\n2. Create skills and AGENTS[.md].\n  - Create and maintain an AGENTS[.md] for any project you work on; update the AGENTS[.md] whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles with a task.\n  - Write skills for anything that you get Codex to do, and commit it to the skills directory in a shared repository\n\n3. Inventory and make accessible any internal tools.\n  - Maintain a list of tools that your team relies on, and make sure someone takes point on making it agent-accessible (such as via a CLI or MCP server).\n\n4. Structure codebases to be agent-first. With the models changing so fast, this is still somewhat untrodden ground, and will require some exploration.\n  - Write tests which are quick to run, and create high-quality interfaces between components.\n\n5. Say no to slop. Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high\n  - Ensure that some human is accountable for any code that gets merged. As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code, and make sure the author understands what they're submitting.\n\n6. Work on basic infra. There's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, which can be guided by internal user feedback. The core tools are getting a lot better and more usable, but there's a lot of infrastructure that currently go around the tools, such as observability, tracking not just the committed code but the agent trajectories that led to them, and central management of the tools that agents are able to use.\n\nOverall, adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out. We encourage every manager to drive this with their team, and to think through other action items — for example, per item 5 above, what else can prevent a lot of \"functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable code\" from creeping into codebases.",

But many people are also so busy they haven't had a chance to try Codex yet or got stuck thinking \"is there any way it could do X\" rather than just trying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designate an \"agents captain\" for your team — the primary person responsible for thinking about how agents can be brought into the teams' workflow.</li>\n<li>Share experiences or questions in a few designated internal channels</li>\n<li>Take a day for a company-wide Codex hackathon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Create skills and AGENTS[.md].</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create and maintain an AGENTS[.md] for any project you work on; update the AGENTS[.md] whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles with a task.</li>\n<li>Write skills for anything that you get Codex to do, and commit it to the skills directory in a shared repository</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. Inventory and make accessible any internal tools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain a list of tools that your team relies on, and make sure someone takes point on making it agent-accessible (such as via a CLI or MCP server).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4. Structure codebases to be agent-first. With the models changing so fast, this is still somewhat untrodden ground, and will require some exploration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write tests which are quick to run, and create high-quality interfaces between components.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5. Say no to slop. Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that some human is accountable for any code that gets merged. As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code, and make sure the author understands what they're submitting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6. Work on basic infra. There's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, which can be guided by internal user feedback. The core tools are getting a lot better and more usable, but there's a lot of infrastructure that currently go around the tools, such as observability, tracking not just the committed code but the agent trajectories that led to them, and central management of the tools that agents are able to use.</p>\n<p>Overall, adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out. We encourage every manager to drive this with their team, and to think through other action items — for example, per item 5 above, what else can prevent a lot of \"functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable code\" from creeping into codebases.</p>"

          "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nLast week I shared preliminary results on a new subquadratic attention mechanism ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary\\_new\\_subquadratic\\_attention\\_20k\\_toks](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary_new_subquadratic_attention_20k_toks)). Following up with the full release: model + inference code are now available.\n\n**TL;DR**: 30B model achieving O(L\\^(3/2)) scaling instead of O(L\\^2). Enables 1M–10M context on a single GPU with decode speeds that stay practical even at extreme context lengths. Ships with an OpenAI-compatible server and CLI to try out.\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear) (\\`pip install superlinear\\`)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)\n\n\n\n**Main Idea**\n\nYou can think of attention as a search algorithm to find relevant information for next-token prediction. Standard attention is basically O(L) brute-force search. We're doing O(L\\^0.5) jump-search with learned routing: score O(L\\^0.5) candidate spans, select top-k, then do token-level attention within the selected spans.\n\nThis gives **O(L\\^(3/2)) total complexity** while preserving **random context access** — any token can be selected by content-dependent routing, unlike fixed sliding windows. When you 10x the context length, the search budget only grows by \\~3.2x. That subquadratic scaling really matters for long context.\n\n\n\n**Performance (Single B200 GPU)**\n\n    | Context Length | Prefill (tok/s) | Decode (tok/s) | Memory  |\n    |----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|\n    | 1M tokens      | ~20,202         | ~109           | 66 GB   |\n    | 10M tokens     | ~5,576          | ~76            | ~120 GB |\n\nKey point: 1M → 10M context (10x increase) only drops decode speed by \\~30%, not the 10x slowdown with dense attention.\n\n\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nWhen you have fast long-context inference, usage patterns change. The key is **maintaining the cache** instead of reprocessing everything:\n\n\\- ***Almost-infinite chat***: KV cache in memory for instant responses, save/restore sessions to disk for persistence\n\n\\- ***Document Q&amp;A***: Load documents once, ask cross-document questions without reprocessing (our GitHub example: 8 Wikipedia articles with cross-document reasoning)\n\n\\- ***Long-form generation***: 20k+ token reasoning on difficult math problems and coherent long article writing, all with maintained context\n\nEarly results: perfect NIAH at 512K context (up from 256K last week), cross-document reasoning working, subquadratic scaling working in practice.\n\nSince no existing inference engine is going to support our custom kernels, we built the full stack ourselves: Triton kernels, OpenAI-compatible server, session snapshots, chunked prefill, CLI with BM25 RAG.\n\n\n\n**Limitations &amp; Next Steps**\n\n***Current limitations:***\n\n\\- This is an \\*\\*architecture + systems feasibility release\\*\\*, not production-quality\n\n\\- Limited training data (initial SFT only)\n\n\\- Comprehensive evals beyond NIAH still needed\n\n\\- FP16 only (66GB for 1M context) — quantization coming soon\n\n***Quantization*** **(coming soon):**\n\n\\- 4-bit/8-bit quantization to run 1M context on 24GB consumer GPUs\n\n\\- Target: RTX 4090 / RTX 5090 with full 1M context\n\n\\- 2M context on 48GB cards (e.g., RTX 6000 Ada)\n\n***Hardware support:***\n\n\\- Currently CUDA only (B200, RTX 6000 Blackwell tested)\n\n\\- AMD ROCm port coming (Triton kernels should make this straightforward)\n\n\\- Eventually Apple Silicon (harder but not impossible)\n\n***Training &amp; Quality improvements:***\n\n\\- Scaling up SFT data with more long-context examples\n\n\\- Potentially doing continued pretraining on long documents\n\n\\- Expanding perfect NIAH range beyond 512K\n\n\\- Real-world long-context benchmarks (book QA, codebase analysis, multi-document reasoning)\n\n***New end-user applications***: We are planning to develop local-first end-user applications based on this. What would you actually use long context for? Would love to hear specific use cases to help us prioritize.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\nTrying something new is extremely hard. Everyone likes existing transformer architectures — optimizations at every level, predictable scaling laws. But to make truly long-context models practical on local hardware, I think we need new ideas. It doesn't hurt to try, right?\n\nI'm trying not to spam this sub, so the GitHub repo is the best place to follow progress. Happy to answer questions here though! If you try it and hit issues, open a GitHub issue. And if you have thoughts on long-context use cases, I'd love to hear them.\n\nThanks for all the encouragement on the last post!\n\n**Links**:\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)",

Ships with an OpenAI-compatible server and CLI to try out.</p>\n<p>\\- 🤗 <strong>Model</strong>: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1</a></p>\n<p>\\- 💻 <strong>Code</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear</a> (\\`pip install superlinear\\`)</p>\n<p>\\- 📄 <strong>Paper</strong>: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401</a></p>\n<p><strong>Main Idea</strong></p>\n<p>You can think of attention as a search algorithm to find relevant information for next-token prediction. Standard attention is basically O(L) brute-force search. We're doing O(L\\^0.5) jump-search with learned routing: score O(L\\^0.5) candidate spans, select top-k, then do token-level attention within the selected spans.</p>\n<p>This gives <strong>O(L\\^(3/2)) total complexity</strong> while preserving <strong>random context access</strong> — any token can be selected by content-dependent routing, unlike fixed sliding windows. When you 10x the context length, the search budget only grows by \\~3.2x. That subquadratic scaling really matters for long context.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance (Single B200 GPU)</strong></p>\n<p>| Context Length | Prefill (tok/s) | Decode (tok/s) | Memory  |</p>\n<p>|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|</p>\n<p>| 1M tokens      | ~20,202         | ~109           | 66 GB   |</p>\n<p>| 10M tokens     | ~5,576          | ~76            | ~120 GB |</p>\n<p>Key point: 1M → 10M context (10x increase) only drops decode speed by \\~30%, not the 10x slowdown with dense attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p>\n<p>When you have fast long-context inference, usage patterns change. The key is <strong>maintaining the cache</strong> instead of reprocessing everything:</p>\n<p>\\- *<strong>Almost-infinite chat</strong>*: KV cache in memory for instant responses, save/restore sessions to disk for persistence</p>\n<p>\\- *<strong>Document Q&amp;A</strong>*: Load documents once, ask cross-document questions without reprocessing (our GitHub example: 8 Wikipedia articles with cross-document reasoning)</p>\n<p>\\- *<strong>Long-form generation</strong>*: 20k+ token reasoning on difficult math problems and coherent long article writing, all with maintained context</p>\n<p>Early results: perfect NIAH at 512K context (up from 256K last week), cross-document reasoning working, subquadratic scaling working in practice.</p>\n<p>Since no existing inference engine is going to support our custom kernels, we built the full stack ourselves: Triton kernels, OpenAI-compatible server, session snapshots, chunked prefill, CLI with BM25 RAG.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations &amp; Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>*<strong>Current limitations:</strong>*</p>\n<p>\\- This is an \\*\\*architecture + systems feasibility release\\*\\*, not production-quality</p>\n<p>\\- Limited training data (initial SFT only)</p>\n<p>\\- Comprehensive evals beyond NIAH still needed</p>\n<p>\\- FP16 only (66GB for 1M context) — quantization coming soon</p>\n<p>*<strong>Quantization</strong>* <strong>(coming soon):</strong></p>\n<p>\\- 4-bit/8-bit quantization to run 1M context on 24GB consumer GPUs</p>\n<p>\\- Target: RTX 4090 / RTX 5090 with full 1M context</p>\n<p>\\- 2M context on 48GB cards (e.g., RTX 6000 Ada)</p>\n<p>*<strong>Hardware support:</strong>*</p>\n<p>\\- Currently CUDA only (B200, RTX 6000 Blackwell tested)</p>\n<p>\\- AMD ROCm port coming (Triton kernels should make this straightforward)</p>\n<p>\\- Eventually Apple Silicon (harder but not impossible)</p>\n<p>*<strong>Training &amp; Quality improvements:</strong>*</p>\n<p>\\- Scaling up SFT data with more long-context examples</p>\n<p>\\- Potentially doing continued pretraining on long documents</p>\n<p>\\- Expanding perfect NIAH range beyond 512K</p>\n<p>\\- Real-world long-context benchmarks (book QA, codebase analysis, multi-document reasoning)</p>\n<p>*<strong>New end-user applications</strong>*: We are planning to develop local-first end-user applications based on this. What would you actually use long context for? Would love to hear specific use cases to help us prioritize.</p>\n<p>\\---</p>\n<p>Trying something new is extremely hard. Everyone likes existing transformer architectures — optimizations at every level, predictable scaling laws. But to make truly long-context models practical on local hardware, I think we need new ideas. It doesn't hurt to try, right?</p>\n<p>I'm trying not to spam this sub, so the GitHub repo is the best place to follow progress. Happy to answer questions here though! If you try it and hit issues, open a GitHub issue. And if you have thoughts on long-context use cases, I'd love to hear them.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the encouragement on the last post!</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong>:</p>\n<p>\\- 🤗 <strong>Model</strong>: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1</a></p>\n<p>\\- 💻 <strong>Code</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear</a></p>\n<p>\\- 📄 <strong>Paper</strong>: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401</a></p>"

It’s faster and smarter than 3B-4B dense models.\n\n\\* Dual-Channel is Mandatory: I’m running 16GB (2x8GB). If you have single-channel, don't even bother; your bandwidth will choke.\n\n\\* Linux is King: I did this on Ubuntu. Windows background processes are a luxury my \"potato\" can't afford.\n\n\\* OpenVINO Integration: Don't use OpenVINO alone—it's dependency hell. Use it as a backend for llama-cpp-python.\n\n\\## The Reality Check\n\n1. First-Run Lag: The iGPU takes time to compile. It might look stuck. Give it a minute—the \"GPU\" is just having his coffee.\n2. Language Drift: On iGPU, it sometimes slips into Chinese tokens, but the logic never breaks.\n\nI’m sharing this because you shouldn't let a lack of money stop you from learning AI.

I’m running DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B MoE) on an HP ProBook 650 G5 (i3-8145U, 16GB Dual-Channel RAM) at near-human reading speeds.</p>\n<p>\\#### The Battle: CPU vs iGPU</p>\n<p>I ran a 20-question head-to-head test with no token limits and real-time streaming.</p>\n<p>| Device | Average Speed | Peak Speed | My Rating |</p>\n<p>| --- | --- | --- | --- |</p>\n<p>| CPU | 8.59 t/s | 9.26 t/s | 8.5/10 - Snappy and solid logic. |</p>\n<p>| iGPU (UHD 620) | 8.99 t/s | 9.73 t/s | 9.0/10 - A beast once it warms up. |</p>\n<p>The Result: The iGPU (OpenVINO) is the winner, proving that even integrated Intel graphics can handle heavy lifting if you set it up right.</p>\n<p>\\## How I Squeezed the Performance:</p>\n<p>\\* MoE is the \"Cheat Code\": 16B parameters sounds huge, but it only calculates 2.4B per token. It’s faster and smarter than 3B-4B dense models.</p>\n<p>\\* Dual-Channel is Mandatory: I’m running 16GB (2x8GB). If you have single-channel, don't even bother; your bandwidth will choke.</p>\n<p>\\* Linux is King: I did this on Ubuntu. Windows background processes are a luxury my \"potato\" can't afford.</p>\n<p>\\* OpenVINO Integration: Don't use OpenVINO alone—it's dependency hell. Use it as a backend for llama-cpp-python.</p>\n<p>\\## The Reality Check</p>\n<p>1. First-Run Lag: The iGPU takes time to compile. It might look stuck. Give it a minute—the \"GPU\" is just having his coffee.</p>\n<p>2. Language Drift: On iGPU, it sometimes slips into Chinese tokens, but the logic never breaks.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing this because you shouldn't let a lack of money stop you from learning AI. If I can do this on an i3 in Burma, you can do it too.</p>"
