We need measures of spans of control for AI. A human tops out at less than 10 direct reports.

It uses a built-in vision model made by Microsoft that converts the browser's screen into a textual description for LLMs.\n\nAgain, Microsoft has built Playwright exactly for what OpenClaw is using it.\n\nSo, OpenClaw's typical workflow:\n\n1. The user types in a text messenger \"Buy me a flashlight on Amazon.\"\n\n2. OpenClaw blindly dispatches this message to an LLM which has access to some tools, including Playwright.\n\n3. The LLM, trained not by OpenClaw folks, decides that Playwright is the right tool (of course it is) and Amazon is the URL to navigate to.\n\n4.

OpenClaw blindly returns to the LLM this textual description.\n\n6. The LLM (again without any help from OpenClaw) decides that one should type \"flashlight\" into the search field and press Search, so it calls the Playwright tool with the search parameters.\n\n7. OpenClaw calls Playwright because the LLM told it to and types \"flashlight\" and then presses Search (it's all part of what Playwright does out of the box).\n\n...\n\nIn the end of this LLM-controlled scenario, the order is submitted.
