      "content": "🚨 Anthropic just dropped Opus 4.6 and I’m already a yes.\n\nI had early access and found myself wanting to wake up early to code. I am a night owl. That should tell you something.\n\nThe reason it stood out (other than what felt like a speed up) is that Opus 4.6 thinks like a coding partner. It felt stronger in software architecture and planning. It was catching its own mistakes more frequently and ran longer without losing its memory or compacting. This is the first Opus model with 1M token context. We needed it. It is also the reason I upgraded from the $100/mo Max plan to the $200/mo plan.\n\nOn real-world knowledge work tasks (finance, legal, operations), it looks like it beats GPT-5.2. On agentic coding, it's the top score on Terminal-Bench 2.0.\n\nOther things worth noting:\n- Agent teams in Claude Code let you spin up multiple agents working in parallel\n- Claude in Excel now handles multi-step changes in one pass\n- Claude in PowerPoint reads your layouts and stays on-brand\n\nOpus 4.6 is live now on https://t.co/VbPFhti1Il and the API. Go test it.\n\nRead the announcement: https://t.co/IWZrJp7yHi",

That should tell you something.</p>\n<p>The reason it stood out (other than what felt like a speed up) is that Opus 4.6 thinks like a coding partner. It felt stronger in software architecture and planning. It was catching its own mistakes more frequently and ran longer without losing its memory or compacting. This is the first Opus model with 1M token context. We needed it. It is also the reason I upgraded from the $100/mo Max plan to the $200/mo plan.</p>\n<p>On real-world knowledge work tasks (finance, legal, operations), it looks like it beats GPT-5.2. On agentic coding, it's the top score on Terminal-Bench 2.0.</p>\n<p>Other things worth noting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agent teams in Claude Code let you spin up multiple agents working in parallel</li>\n<li>Claude in Excel now handles multi-step changes in one pass</li>\n<li>Claude in PowerPoint reads your layouts and stays on-brand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opus 4.6 is live now on https://t.co/VbPFhti1Il and the API.

Don't fix a bug unless there's a test that shows it.\n\nSecond option:\n\nUse a specialized tool to generate tests for you. I'm working with @testmuai's KaneAI (TestMu AI formerly LambdaTest), and it's very simple to generate end-to-end test cases for your code:\n\nYou explain what you want to test: \"Log in with valid credentials, navigate to the dashboard, verify the chart loads.\"\n\nThe tool will generate end-to-end test code in your language using your framework of choice.\n\nYou can feed KaneAI a Jira ticket, a PDF, or even a screenshot, and it will generate structured test cases from that input.\n\nThis alone will save you hours of manual work.\n\nSomething really cool:\n\nWhenever your UI changes, the tests will automatically adapt based on the original intent you specified. This will prevent tests from rotting.\n\nThere's a lot more to KaneAI I still need to discover, but it looks really awesome.\n\nIf you want to check it out, go here:\nhttps://t.co/7AcezYLW33\n\nThanks to the KaneAI team for partnering with me on this post.",

      "content_html": "<p>You have two options:</p>\n<p>First option:</p>\n<p>Use your favorite agentic coding platform to write tests for any new feature you build. Don't fix a bug unless there's a test that shows it.</p>\n<p>Second option:</p>\n<p>Use a specialized tool to generate tests for you. I'm working with @testmuai's KaneAI (TestMu AI formerly LambdaTest), and it's very simple to generate end-to-end test cases for your code:</p>\n<p>You explain what you want to test: \"Log in with valid credentials, navigate to the dashboard, verify the chart loads.\"</p>\n<p>The tool will generate end-to-end test code in your language using your framework of choice.</p>\n<p>You can feed KaneAI a Jira ticket, a PDF, or even a screenshot, and it will generate structured test cases from that input.</p>\n<p>This alone will save you hours of manual work.</p>\n<p>Something really cool:</p>\n<p>Whenever your UI changes, the tests will automatically adapt based on the original intent you specified. This will prevent tests from rotting.</p>\n<p>There's a lot more to KaneAI I still need to discover, but it looks really awesome.</p>\n<p>If you want to check it out, go here:</p>\n<p>https://t.co/7AcezYLW33</p>\n<p>Thanks to the KaneAI team for partnering with me on this post.</p>"
