Just make this or that. Each level up, you speak more like a human and less like a machine. The AI handles more of the translation.\n\nNow think about film, media, games. Entertainment in general.

There is a huge internal market in China, which has 10 cities that are significantly larger than New York.</p>\n<p>3. They have many more factories than we have in America.</p>\n<p>That is really where the big market is, at least for the first couple of years. The Chinese are already getting the kids in Abu Dhabi to use their robots; I don't see any American robots there. I know what that means over a 40-year horizon: it is going to be very hard to compete with the Chinese.</p>\n<p>Elon can do it, and maybe Brett can do it. Regarding the 1X Technologies effort, I just don't see how that is going to be a big deal because home users generally don't buy a $20,000 thing. We'll see—I have one on order, but I am still very skeptical of that as well.</p>"
