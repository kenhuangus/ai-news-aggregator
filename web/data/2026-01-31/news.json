      "content": "AI News for 1/28/2026-1/29/2026. We checked 12 subreddits, 544 Twitters and 24 Discords (253 channels, and 7278 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 605 minutes. AINews&#8217; website lets you search all past issues. As a reminder, AINews is now a section of Latent Space. You can opt in/out of email frequencies!It looks like OpenAI (fundraising at around ~800b), Anthropic (worth $350b) and now SpaceX + xAI ($1100B? - folllowing their $20B Series E 3 weeks ago) are in a dead heat racing to IPO by year end. Google made an EXTREMELY strong play today launching Genie 3 (previously reported) to Ultra subscribers, and though technically impressive,, today&#8217;s headline story rightfully belongs to Grok, who now have the SOTA Image/Video Generation and Editing model released in API that you can use today.Artificial Analysis&#8217; rankings says it all:There&#8217;s not much else to say here apart from look at the list of small video model labs and wonder which of them just got bitter lessoned&#8230;&#8212;-AI Twitter RecapWorld Models &amp; Interactive Simulation: Google DeepMind&#8217;s Project Genie (Genie 3) vs. Open-Source &#8220;World Simulators&#8221;Project Genie rollout (Genie 3 + Nano Banana Pro + Gemini): Google/DeepMind launched Project Genie, a prototype that lets users create and explore interactive, real-time generated worlds from text or image prompts, with remixing and a gallery. Availability is currently gated to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. (18+), and the product is explicit about prototype limitations (e.g., ~60s generation limits, control latency, imperfect physics adherence) (DeepMind announcement, how it works, rollout details, Demis, Sundar, Google thread, Google limitations). Early-access testers highlight promptability, character/world customization, and &#8220;remixing&#8221; as key UX hooks (venturetwins, Josh Woodward demo thread).Open-source push: LingBot-World: A parallel thread frames world models as distinct from &#8220;video dreamers,&#8221; arguing for interactivity, object permanence, and causal consistency. LingBot-World is repeatedly described as an open-source real-time interactive world model built on Wan2.2 with &lt;1s latency at 16 FPS and minute-level coherence (claims include VBench improvements and landmark persistence after long occlusion) (paper-summary thread, HuggingPapers mention, reaction clip). The meta-narrative: proprietary systems (Genie) are shipping consumer prototypes while open systems race to close capability gaps on coherence + control.Video Generation &amp; Creative Tooling: xAI Grok Imagine, Runway Gen-4.5, and fal&#8217;s &#8220;Day-0&#8221; PlatformsxAI Grok Imagine (video + audio) lands near/at the top of leaderboards: Multiple sources report Grok Imagine&#8217;s strong debut in video rankings and emphasize native audio, 15s duration, and aggressive pricing ($4.20/min including audio) relative to Veo/Sora (Arena launch ranking, Artificial Analysis #1 claim + pricing context, follow-up #1 I2V leaderboard, xAI team announcement, Elon). fal positioned itself as day-0 platform partner with API endpoints for text-to-image, editing, text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing (fal partnership, fal links tweet).Runway Gen-4.5 shifts toward &#8220;animation engine&#8221; workflows: Creators describe Gen-4.5 as increasingly controllable for animation-style work (c_valenzuelab). Runway shipped Motion Sketch (annotate camera/motion on a start frame) and Character Swap as built-in apps&#8212;more evidence that vendors are packaging controllability primitives rather than only pushing base quality (feature thread). Runway also markets &#8220;photo &#8594; story clip&#8221; flows as a mainstream onramp (Runway example).3D generation joins the same API distribution layer: fal also added Hunyuan 3D 3.1 Pro/Rapid (text/image-to-3D, topology/part generation), showing the same &#8220;model-as-a-service + workflow endpoints&#8221; pattern spreading from image/video into 3D pipelines (fal drop).Open Models &amp; Benchmarks: Kimi K2.5 momentum, Qwen3-ASR release, and Trinity Large architecture detailsKimi K2.5 as the &#8220;#1 open model&#8221; across multiple eval surfaces: Moonshot promoted K2.5&#8217;s rank on VoxelBench (Moonshot) and later Kimi updates focus on productization: Kimi Code now powered by K2.5, switching from request limits to token-based billing, plus a limited-time 3&#215; quota/no throttling event (Kimi Code billing update, billing rationale). Arena messaging amplifies K2.5 as a leading open model with forthcoming Code Arena scores (Arena deep dive, Code Arena prompt); Arena also claims Kimi K2.5 Thinking as #1 open model in Vision Arena and the only open model in the top 15 (Vision Arena claim). Commentary frames K2.5 as &#8220;V3-generation architecture pushed with more continued training,&#8221; with next-gen competition expected from K3/GLM-5 etc. (teortaxes).Alibaba Qwen3-ASR: production-grade open speech stack with vLLM day-0 support: Qwen released Qwen3-ASR + Qwen3-ForcedAligner emphasizing messy real-world audio, 52 languages/dialects, long audio (up to 20 minutes/pass), and timestamps; models are Apache 2.0 and include an open inference/finetuning stack. vLLM immediately announced day-0 support and performance notes (e.g., &#8220;2000&#215; throughput on 0.6B&#8221; in their tweet) (Qwen release, ForcedAligner, vLLM support, Adina Yakup summary, native streaming claim, Qwen thanks vLLM). Net: open-source speech is increasingly &#8220;full-stack,&#8221; not just weights.Arcee AI Trinity Large (400B MoE) enters the architecture discourse: Multiple threads summarize Trinity Large as 400B MoE with ~13B active, tuned for throughput via sparse expert selection, and featuring a grab bag of modern stability/throughput techniques (router tricks, load balancing, attention patterns, normalization variants). Sebastian Raschka&#8217;s architecture recap is the most concrete single reference point (rasbt); additional MoE/router stability notes appear in a separate technical summary (cwolferesearch). Arcee notes multiple variants trending on Hugging Face (arcee_ai).Agents in Practice: &#8220;Agentic Engineering,&#8221; Multi-Agent Coordination, and Enterprise SandboxesFrom vibe coding to agentic engineering: A high-engagement meme-like anchor tweet argues for &#8220;Agentic Engineering &gt; Vibe Coding&#8221; and frames professionalism around repeatable workflows rather than vibes (bekacru). Several threads reinforce the same theme operationally: context prep, evaluations, and sandboxing as the hard parts.Primer: repo instructions + lightweight evals + PR automation: Primer proposes a workflow for &#8220;AI-enabling&#8221; repos: agentic repo introspection &#8594; generate an instruction file &#8594; run a with/without eval harness &#8594; scale via batch PRs across org repos (Primer launch, local run, eval framework, org scaling).Agent sandboxes + traceability as infra primitives: Multiple tweets point to &#8220;agent sandboxes&#8221; (isolated execution environments) as an emerging January trend (dejavucoder). Cursor proposed an open standard to trace agent conversations to generated code, explicitly positioning it as interoperable across agents/interfaces (Cursor). This pairs with broader ecosystem pressure: agents need auditability and reliable grounding when they can take actions.Multi-agent coordination beats &#8220;bigger brain&#8221; framing: A popular summary claims a system that uses a controller trained by RL to route between large/small models can beat a single large agent on HLE with lower cost/latency&#8212;reinforcing that orchestration policies are becoming first-class artifacts (LiorOnAI). In the same direction, an Amazon &#8220;Insight Agents&#8221; paper summary argues for pragmatic manager-worker designs with lightweight OOD detection and routing (autoencoder + fine-tuned BERT) instead of LLM-only classifiers for latency/precision reasons (omarsar0).Kimi&#8217;s &#8220;Agent Swarm&#8221; philosophy: A long-form repost from ZhihuFrontier describes K2.5&#8217;s agent mode as a response to &#8220;text-only helpfulness&#8221; and tool-call hallucinations, emphasizing planning&#8594;execution bridging, dynamic tool-based context, and multi-viewpoint planning via swarms (ZhihuFrontier).Moltbot/Clawdbot safety trilemma: Community discussion frames &#8220;Useful vs Autonomous vs Safe&#8221; as a tri-constraint until prompt injection is solved (fabianstelzer). Another take argues capability (trust) bottlenecks dominate: users won&#8217;t grant high-stakes autonomy (e.g., finance) until agents are reliably competent (Yuchenj_UW).Model UX, DevTools, and Serving: Gemini Agentic Vision, OpenAI&#8217;s in-house data agent, vLLM fixes, and local LLM appsGemini 3 Flash &#8220;Agentic Vision&#8221;: Google positions Agentic Vision as a structured image-analysis pipeline: planning steps, zooming, annotating, and optionally running Python for plotting&#8212;essentially turning &#8220;vision&#8221; into an agentic workflow rather than a single forward pass (GeminiApp intro, capabilities, rollout note).OpenAI&#8217;s in-house data agent at massive scale: OpenAI described an internal &#8220;AI data agent&#8221; reasoning over 600+ PB and 70k datasets, using Codex-powered table knowledge and careful context management (OpenAIDevs). This is a rare concrete peek at &#8220;deep research/data agent&#8221; architecture constraints: retrieval + schema/table priors + org context.Serving bugs are still real (vLLM + stateful models): AI21 shared a debugging story where scheduler token allocation caused misclassification between prefill vs decode, now fixed in vLLM v0.14.0&#8212;a reminder that infrastructure correctness matters, especially for stateful architectures like Mamba (AI21Labs thread).Local LLM UX continues to improve: Georgi Gerganov shipped LlamaBarn, a tiny macOS menu bar app built on llama.cpp to run local models (ggerganov). Separate comments suggest agentic coding performance may improve by disabling &#8220;thinking&#8221; modes for specific models (GLM-4.7-Flash) via llama.cpp templates (ggerganov config note).Top tweets (by engagement)Grok Imagine hype &amp; distribution: @elonmusk, @fal, @ArtificialAnlysDeepMind/Google world models: @GoogleDeepMind, @demishassabis, @sundarpichaiAI4Science: @demishassabis on AlphaGenomeSpeech open-source release: @Alibaba_Qwen Qwen3-ASRAgents + developer workflow: @bekacru &#8220;Agentic Engineering &gt; Vibe Coding&#8221;, @cursor_ai agent-trace.devAnthropic workplace study: @AnthropicAI AI-assisted coding and masteryAI Reddit Recap/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap1. Kimi K2.5 Model Discussions and ReleasesAMA With Kimi, The Open-source Frontier Lab Behind Kimi K2.5 Model (Activity: 686): Kimi is the research lab behind the open-source Kimi K2.5 model, engaging in an AMA to discuss their work. The discussion highlights a focus on large-scale models, with inquiries about the development of smaller models like 8B, 32B, and 70B for better intelligence density. There is also interest in smaller Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, such as ~100B total with ~A3B active, optimized for local or prosumer use. The team is questioned on their stance regarding the notion that Scaling Laws have hit a wall, a topic of current debate in AI research. Commenters express a desire for smaller, more efficient models, suggesting that these could offer better performance for specific use cases. The debate on scaling laws reflects a broader concern in the AI community about the limits of current model scaling strategies.The discussion around model sizes highlights a preference for smaller models like 8B, 32B, and 70B due to their &#8216;intelligence density.&#8217; These sizes are considered optimal for balancing performance and resource efficiency, suggesting a demand for models that can operate effectively on limited hardware while still providing robust capabilities.The inquiry into smaller Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, such as a ~100B total with ~A3B active, indicates interest in models optimized for local or prosumer use. This reflects a trend towards developing models that are not only powerful but also accessible for individual users or small enterprises, emphasizing the need for efficient resource utilization without sacrificing performance.The challenge of maintaining non-coding abilities like creative writing and emotional intelligence in models like Kimi 2.5 is significant, especially as coding benchmarks become more prominent. The team is tasked with ensuring these softer skills do not regress, which involves balancing the training focus between technical and creative capabilities to meet diverse user needs.Run Kimi K2.5 Locally (Activity: 553): The image provides a guide for running the Kimi-K2.5 model locally, emphasizing its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in vision, coding, agentic, and chat tasks. The model, which is a 1 trillion parameter hybrid reasoning model, requires 600GB of disk space, but the quantized Unsloth Dynamic 1.8-bit version reduces this requirement to 240GB, a 60% reduction. The guide includes instructions for using llama.cpp to load models and demonstrates generating HTML code for a simple game. The model is available on Hugging Face and further documentation can be found on Unsloth&#8217;s official site. Commenters discuss the feasibility of running the model on high-end hardware, with one user questioning its performance on a Strix Halo setup and another highlighting the substantial VRAM requirements, suggesting that only a few users can realistically run it locally.Daniel_H212 is inquiring about the performance of the Kimi K2.5 model on the Strix Halo hardware, specifically asking for the token generation speed in seconds per token. This suggests a focus on benchmarking the model&#8217;s efficiency on high-end hardware setups.Marksta provides feedback on the quantized version of the Kimi K2.5 model, specifically the Q2_K_XL variant. They note that the model maintains high coherence and adheres strictly to prompts, which is characteristic of Kimi-K2&#8217;s style. However, they also mention that while the model&#8217;s creative capabilities have improved, it still struggles with execution in creative scenarios, often delivering logical but poorly written responses.MikeRoz questions the utility of higher quantization levels like Q5 and Q6 (e.g., UD-Q5_K_XL, Q6_K) when most experts prefer int4 quantization. This highlights a debate on the trade-offs between model size, performance, and precision in quantization strategies.Kimi K2.5 is the best open model for coding (Activity: 1119): The image highlights Kimi K2.5 as the leading open model for coding on the LMARENA.AI leaderboard, ranked #7 overall. This model is noted for its superior performance in coding tasks compared to other open models. The leaderboard provides a comparative analysis of various AI models, showcasing their ranks, scores, and confidence intervals, emphasizing Kimi K2.5&#8217;s achievements in the coding domain. One commenter compared Kimi K2.5&#8217;s performance to other models, noting it is on par with Sonnet 4.5 in accuracy but not as advanced as Opus in agentic function. Another comment criticized LMArena for not reflecting a model&#8217;s multi-turn or long context capabilities.A user compared Kimi K2.5 to other models, noting that it performs on par with Sonnet 4.5 in terms of accuracy for React projects, but not at the level of Opus in terms of agentic function. They also mentioned that Kimi 2.5 surpasses GLM 4.7, which was their previous choice, and expressed curiosity about the upcoming GLM-5 from z.ai.Another commenter criticized LMArena, stating that it fails to provide insights into a model&#8217;s multi-turn, long context, or agentic capabilities, implying that such benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating comprehensive model performance.A user highlighted the cost-effectiveness of Kimi K2.5, stating it feels as competent as Opus 4.5 while being significantly cheaper, approximately 1/5th the cost, and even less expensive than Haiku. This suggests a strong performance-to-cost ratio for Kimi K2.5.Finally We have the best agentic AI at home (Activity: 464): The image is a performance comparison chart of various AI models, including Kimi K2.5, GPT-5.2 (xhigh), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro. Kimi K2.5 is highlighted as the top-performing model across multiple categories such as agents, coding, image, and video tasks, indicating its superior capabilities in multimodal applications. The post suggests excitement about integrating this model with a &#8216;clawdbot&#8217;, hinting at potential applications in robotics or automation. A comment humorously suggests that hosting the Kimi 2.5 1T+ model at home implies having a large home, indicating the model&#8217;s likely high computational requirements. Another comment sarcastically mentions handling it with a 16GB VRAM card, implying skepticism about the feasibility of running such a model on typical consumer hardware.2. Open Source Model InnovationsLingBot-World outperforms Genie 3 in dynamic simulation and is fully Open Source (Activity: 230): The open-source framework LingBot-World surpasses the proprietary Genie 3 in dynamic simulation capabilities, achieving 16 FPS and maintaining object consistency for 60 seconds outside the field of view. This model, available on Hugging Face, offers enhanced handling of complex physics and scene transitions, challenging the monopoly of proprietary systems by providing full access to its code and model weights. Commenters question the hardware requirements for running LingBot-World and express skepticism about the comparison with Genie 3, suggesting a lack of empirical evidence or direct access to Genie 3 for a fair comparison.A user questioned the hardware requirements for running LingBot-World, highlighting the importance of specifying computational needs for practical implementation. This is crucial for users to understand the feasibility of deploying the model in various environments.Another commenter raised concerns about the lack of a direct comparison with Genie 3, suggesting that without empirical data or benchmarks, claims of LingBot-World&#8217;s superiority might be unsubstantiated. This points to the need for transparent and rigorous benchmarking to validate performance claims.A suggestion was made to integrate a smaller version of LingBot-World into a global illumination stack, indicating potential applications in graphics and rendering. This could leverage the model&#8217;s capabilities in dynamic simulation to enhance visual computing tasks.API pricing is in freefall. What&#8217;s the actual case for running local now beyond privacy? (Activity: 1053): The post discusses the rapidly decreasing costs of API access for AI models, with examples like K2.5 offering prices at 10% of Opus and Deepseek being nearly free. Gemini also provides a substantial free tier. This trend is contrasted with the challenges of running large models locally, such as the need for expensive GPUs or dealing with quantization tradeoffs, which result in slow processing speeds (15 tok/s) on consumer hardware. The author questions the viability of local setups given these API pricing trends, noting that while privacy and latency control are valid reasons, the cost-effectiveness of local setups is diminishing. Commenters highlight concerns about the sustainability of low API prices, suggesting they may rise once market dominance is achieved, similar to past trends in other industries. Others emphasize the importance of offline capabilities and the ability to audit and trust local models, which ensures consistent behavior without unexpected changes from vendors.Minimum-Vanilla949 highlights the importance of offline capabilities for those who travel frequently, emphasizing the risk of API companies altering terms of service or increasing prices once they dominate the market. This underscores the value of local models for ensuring consistent access and cost control.05032-MendicantBias discusses the unsustainable nature of current API pricing, which is often subsidized by venture capital. They argue that once a monopoly is achieved, prices will likely increase, making local setups and open-source tools a strategic defense against such business models.IactaAleaEst2021 points out the importance of repeatability and trust in using local models. By downloading and auditing a model, users can ensure consistent behavior, unlike APIs where vendors might change model behavior over time, potentially reducing its utility for specific tasks.3. Trends in AI Agent FrameworksGitHub trending this week: half the repos are agent frameworks. 90% will be dead in 1 week. (Activity: 538): The image highlights a trend on GitHub where many of the trending repositories are related to AI agent frameworks, suggesting a surge in interest in these tools. However, the post&#8217;s title and comments express skepticism about the sustainability of this trend, comparing it to the rapid rise and fall of JavaScript frameworks. The repositories are mostly written in Python and include a mix of agent frameworks, RAG tooling, and model-related projects like NanoGPT and Grok. The discussion reflects a concern that many of these projects may not maintain their popularity or relevance over time. One comment challenges the claim that half of the trending repositories are agent frameworks, noting that only one is an agent framework by Microsoft, while others are related to RAG tooling and model development. Another comment appreciates the utility of certain projects, like IPTV, for educational purposes.gscjj points out that the claim about &#8216;half the repos being agent frameworks&#8217; is inaccurate. They note that the list includes a variety of projects such as Microsoft&#8217;s agent framework, RAG tooling, and models like NanoGPT and Grok, as well as a model CLI for code named Kimi and a browser API. This suggests a diverse range of trending repositories rather than a dominance of agent frameworks.Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch: &#8220;If you treat intelligence as electricity, then you just want to make sure that your access to intelligence cannot be throttled.&#8221; (Activity: 357): Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral, advocates for open-weight models, likening intelligence to electricity, emphasizing the importance of unrestricted access to AI capabilities. This approach supports the deployment of models on local devices, reducing costs as models are quantized for lower compute environments, contrasting with closed models that are often large and monetized through paywalls. Mistral aims to balance corporate interests with open access, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in AI deployment. Commenters appreciate Mistral&#8217;s approach to open models, noting the potential for reduced costs and increased accessibility. There is a consensus that open models could democratize AI usage, contrasting with the restrictive nature of closed models.RoyalCities highlights the cost dynamics of model deployment, noting that open models, especially when quantized, reduce costs as they can be run on local devices. This contrasts with closed models that are often large and require significant infrastructure, thus being monetized through paywalls. This reflects a broader industry trend where open models aim to democratize access by lowering hardware requirements.HugoCortell points out the hardware bottleneck in deploying open models effectively. While open-source models can rival closed-source ones in performance, the lack of affordable, high-performance hardware limits their accessibility. This is compounded by large companies making high-quality local hardware increasingly expensive, suggesting a need for a company capable of producing and distributing its own hardware to truly democratize AI access.tarruda expresses anticipation for the next open Mistral model, specifically the &#8220;8x22&#8221;. This indicates a community interest in the technical specifications and potential performance improvements of upcoming models, reflecting the importance of open model development in advancing AI capabilities.Less Technical AI Subreddit Recap/r/Singularity, /r/Oobabooga, /r/MachineLearning, /r/OpenAI, /r/ClaudeAI, /r/StableDiffusion, /r/ChatGPT, /r/ChatGPTCoding, /r/aivideo, /r/aivideo1. OpenAI and AGI InvestmentsNearly half of the Mag 7 are reportedly betting big on OpenAI&#8217;s path to AGI (Activity: 1153): NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Amazon are reportedly in discussions to invest a combined total of up to $60 billion into OpenAI, with SoftBank considering an additional $30 billion. This potential investment could value OpenAI at approximately $730 billion pre-money, aligning with recent valuation discussions in the $750 billion to $850 billion+ range. This would mark one of the largest private capital raises in history, highlighting the significant financial commitment from major tech companies towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Commenters note the strategic alignment of these investments, with one pointing out that companies like Microsoft and NVIDIA are unlikely to invest in competitors like Google. Another comment reflects on the evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) and the shifting focus of tech giants.CoolStructure6012 highlights the strategic alignment between Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with OpenAI, suggesting that their investments are logical given their competitive stance against Google. This reflects the broader industry trend where tech giants are aligning with AI leaders to bolster their AI capabilities and market positions.drewc717 reflects on the evolution of AI models, noting a significant productivity boost with OpenAI&#8217;s 4.1 Pro mode. However, they express a decline in their workflow efficiency after switching to Gemini, indicating that not all LLMs provide the same level of user experience or productivity, which is crucial for developers relying on these tools.EmbarrassedRing7806 questions the lack of attention on Anthropic despite its widespread use in coding through its Claude model, as opposed to OpenAI&#8217;s Codex. This suggests a potential underestimation of Anthropic&#8217;s impact in the AI coding space, where Claude might be offering competitive or superior capabilities.2. DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaGenome LaunchGoogle DeepMind launches AlphaGenome, an AI model that analyzes up to 1 million DNA bases to predict genomic regulation (Activity: 427): Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaGenome, a sequence model capable of analyzing up to 1 million DNA bases to predict genomic regulation, as detailed in Nature. The model excels in predicting genomic signals such as gene expression and chromatin structure, particularly in non-coding DNA, which is crucial for understanding disease-associated variants. AlphaGenome outperforms existing models on 25 of 26 benchmark tasks and is available for research use, with its model and weights accessible on GitHub. Commenters highlight the model&#8217;s potential impact on genomics, with some humorously suggesting its significance in advancing scientific achievements akin to winning Nobel prizes.[R] AlphaGenome: DeepMind&#8217;s unified DNA sequence model predicts regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-bp resolution (Nature 2026) (Activity: 66): DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaGenome introduces a unified DNA sequence model that predicts regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-base-pair resolution. The model processes 1M base pairs of DNA to predict thousands of functional genomic tracks, matching or exceeding specialized models in 25 of 26 evaluations. It employs a U-Net backbone with CNN and transformer layers, trained on human and mouse genomes, and captures 99% of validated enhancer-gene pairs within a 1Mb context. Training on TPUv3 took 4 hours, with inference under 1 second on H100. The model demonstrates cross-modal variant interpretation, notably on the TAL1 oncogene in T-ALL. Nature, bioRxiv, DeepMind blog, GitHub. Some commenters view the model as an incremental improvement over existing sequence models, questioning the novelty despite its publication in Nature. Others express concerns about the implications of open-sourcing such powerful genomic tools, hinting at potential future applications like &#8216;text to CRISPR&#8217; models.st8ic88 argues that while DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaGenome model is notable for its ability to predict regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-base pair resolution, it is seen as an incremental improvement over existing sequence models predicting genomic tracks. The comment suggests that the model&#8217;s prominence is partly due to DeepMind&#8217;s reputation and branding, particularly the use of &#8216;Alpha&#8217; in its name, which may have contributed to its publication in Nature.--MCMC-- is interested in the differences between the AlphaGenome model&#8217;s preprint and its final published version in Nature. The commenter had read the preprint and is curious about any changes made during the peer review process, which could include updates to the model&#8217;s methodology, results, or interpretations.f0urtyfive raises concerns about the potential risks of open-sourcing powerful genomic models like AlphaGenome, speculating on future developments such as &#8216;text to CRISPR&#8217; models. This comment highlights the ethical and safety considerations of making advanced genomic prediction tools widely accessible, which could lead to unintended applications or misuse.3. Claude&#8217;s Cost Efficiency and Usage StrategiesClaude Subscriptions are up to 36x cheaper than API (and why &#8220;Max 5x&#8221; is the real sweet spot) (Activity: 665): A data analyst has reverse-engineered Claude&#8217;s internal usage limits by analyzing unrounded floats in the web interface, revealing that subscriptions can be up to 36x cheaper than using the API, especially for coding tasks with agents like Claude Code. The analysis shows that the subscription model offers free cache reads, whereas the API charges 10% of the input cost for each read, making the subscription significantly more cost-effective for long sessions. The &#8220;Max 5x&#8221; plan at $100/month is highlighted as the most optimized, offering a 6x higher session limit and 8.3x higher weekly limit than the Pro plan, contrary to the marketed &#8220;5x&#8221; and &#8220;20x&#8221; plans. The findings were derived using the Stern-Brocot tree to decode precise usage percentages into internal credit numbers. Full details and formulas are available here. Commenters express concern over Anthropic&#8217;s lack of transparency and speculate that the company might change the limits once they realize users have reverse-engineered them. Some users are taking advantage of the current subscription benefits, anticipating potential changes.HikariWS raises a critical point about Anthropic&#8217;s lack of transparency regarding their subscription limits, which could change unexpectedly, rendering current analyses obsolete. This unpredictability poses a risk for developers relying on these plans for cost-effective usage.Isaenkodmitry discusses the potential for Anthropic to close loopholes once they realize users are exploiting subscription plans for cheaper access compared to the API. This highlights a strategic risk for developers who are currently benefiting from these plans, suggesting they should maximize usage while it lasts.Snow30303 mentions using Claude code in VS Code for Flutter apps, noting that it consumes credits rapidly. This suggests a need for more efficient usage strategies or alternative solutions to manage costs effectively when integrating Claude into development workflows.We reduced Claude API costs by 94.5% using a file tiering system (with proof) (Activity: 603): The post describes a file tiering system that reduces Claude API costs by 94.5% by categorizing files into HOT, WARM, and COLD tiers, thus minimizing the number of tokens processed per session. This system, implemented in a tool called cortex-tms, tags files based on their relevance and usage frequency, allowing only the most necessary files to be loaded by default. The approach has been validated through a case study on the author&#8217;s project, showing a reduction from 66,834 to 3,647 tokens per session, significantly lowering costs from $0.11 to $0.01 per session with Claude Sonnet 4.5. The tool is open-source and available on GitHub. One commenter inquired about the manual process of tagging files and updating tags, suggesting the use of git history to automate file heat determination. Another user appreciated the approach due to their own struggles with managing API credits.Illustrious-Report96 suggests using git history to determine file &#8216;heat&#8217;, which involves analyzing the frequency and recency of changes to classify files as &#8216;hot&#8217;, &#8216;warm&#8217;, or &#8216;cold&#8217;. This method leverages version control metadata to automate the classification process, potentially reducing manual tagging efforts.Accomplished_Buy9342 inquires about restricting access to &#8216;WARM&#8217; and &#8216;COLD&#8217; files, which implies a need for a mechanism to control agent access based on file tier. This could involve implementing access controls or modifying the agent&#8217;s logic to prioritize &#8216;HOT&#8217; files, ensuring efficient resource usage.durable-racoon asks about the process of tagging files and updating these tags, highlighting the importance of an automated or semi-automated system to manage file tiering efficiently. This could involve scripts or tools that dynamically update file tags based on usage patterns or other criteria.",

Google made an EXTREMELY strong play today launching Genie 3 (previously reported) to Ultra subscribers, and though technically impressive,, today’s headline story rightfully belongs to Grok, who now have the SOTA Image/Video Generation and Editing model released in API that you can use today.Artificial Analysis’ rankings says it all:There’s not much else to say here apart from look at the list of small video model labs and wonder which of them just got bitter lessoned…—-AI Twitter RecapWorld Models &amp; Interactive Simulation: Google DeepMind’s Project Genie (Genie 3) vs. Open-Source “World Simulators”Project Genie rollout (Genie 3 + Nano Banana Pro + Gemini): Google/DeepMind launched Project Genie, a prototype that lets users create and explore interactive, real-time generated worlds from text or image prompts, with remixing and a gallery. Availability is currently gated to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. (18+), and the product is explicit about prototype limitations (e.g., ~60s generation limits, control latency, imperfect physics adherence) (DeepMind announcement, how it works, rollout details, Demis, Sundar, Google thread, Google limitations). Early-access testers highlight promptability, character/world customization, and “remixing” as key UX hooks (venturetwins, Josh Woodward demo thread).Open-source push: LingBot-World: A parallel thread frames world models as distinct from “video dreamers,” arguing for interactivity, object permanence, and causal consistency. LingBot-World is repeatedly described as an open-source real-time interactive world model built on Wan2.2 with &lt;1s latency at 16 FPS and minute-level coherence (claims include VBench improvements and landmark persistence after long occlusion) (paper-summary thread, HuggingPapers mention, reaction clip). The meta-narrative: proprietary systems (Genie) are shipping consumer prototypes while open systems race to close capability gaps on coherence + control.Video Generation &amp; Creative Tooling: xAI Grok Imagine, Runway Gen-4.5, and fal’s “Day-0” PlatformsxAI Grok Imagine (video + audio) lands near/at the top of leaderboards: Multiple sources report Grok Imagine’s strong debut in video rankings and emphasize native audio, 15s duration, and aggressive pricing ($4.20/min including audio) relative to Veo/Sora (Arena launch ranking, Artificial Analysis #1 claim + pricing context, follow-up #1 I2V leaderboard, xAI team announcement, Elon). fal positioned itself as day-0 platform partner with API endpoints for text-to-image, editing, text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing (fal partnership, fal links tweet).Runway Gen-4.5 shifts toward “animation engine” workflows: Creators describe Gen-4.5 as increasingly controllable for animation-style work (c_valenzuelab). Runway shipped Motion Sketch (annotate camera/motion on a start frame) and Character Swap as built-in apps—more evidence that vendors are packaging controllability primitives rather than only pushing base quality (feature thread). Runway also markets “photo → story clip” flows as a mainstream onramp (Runway example).3D generation joins the same API distribution layer: fal also added Hunyuan 3D 3.1 Pro/Rapid (text/image-to-3D, topology/part generation), showing the same “model-as-a-service + workflow endpoints” pattern spreading from image/video into 3D pipelines (fal drop).Open Models &amp; Benchmarks: Kimi K2.5 momentum, Qwen3-ASR release, and Trinity Large architecture detailsKimi K2.5 as the “#1 open model” across multiple eval surfaces: Moonshot promoted K2.5’s rank on VoxelBench (Moonshot) and later Kimi updates focus on productization: Kimi Code now powered by K2.5, switching from request limits to token-based billing, plus a limited-time 3× quota/no throttling event (Kimi Code billing update, billing rationale). Arena messaging amplifies K2.5 as a leading open model with forthcoming Code Arena scores (Arena deep dive, Code Arena prompt); Arena also claims Kimi K2.5 Thinking as #1 open model in Vision Arena and the only open model in the top 15 (Vision Arena claim). Commentary frames K2.5 as “V3-generation architecture pushed with more continued training,” with next-gen competition expected from K3/GLM-5 etc. (teortaxes).Alibaba Qwen3-ASR: production-grade open speech stack with vLLM day-0 support: Qwen released Qwen3-ASR + Qwen3-ForcedAligner emphasizing messy real-world audio, 52 languages/dialects, long audio (up to 20 minutes/pass), and timestamps; models are Apache 2.0 and include an open inference/finetuning stack. vLLM immediately announced day-0 support and performance notes (e.g., “2000× throughput on 0.6B” in their tweet) (Qwen release, ForcedAligner, vLLM support, Adina Yakup summary, native streaming claim, Qwen thanks vLLM). Net: open-source speech is increasingly “full-stack,” not just weights.Arcee AI Trinity Large (400B MoE) enters the architecture discourse: Multiple threads summarize Trinity Large as 400B MoE with ~13B active, tuned for throughput via sparse expert selection, and featuring a grab bag of modern stability/throughput techniques (router tricks, load balancing, attention patterns, normalization variants). Sebastian Raschka’s architecture recap is the most concrete single reference point (rasbt); additional MoE/router stability notes appear in a separate technical summary (cwolferesearch). Arcee notes multiple variants trending on Hugging Face (arcee_ai).Agents in Practice: “Agentic Engineering,” Multi-Agent Coordination, and Enterprise SandboxesFrom vibe coding to agentic engineering: A high-engagement meme-like anchor tweet argues for “Agentic Engineering &gt; Vibe Coding” and frames professionalism around repeatable workflows rather than vibes (bekacru). Several threads reinforce the same theme operationally: context prep, evaluations, and sandboxing as the hard parts.Primer: repo instructions + lightweight evals + PR automation: Primer proposes a workflow for “AI-enabling” repos: agentic repo introspection → generate an instruction file → run a with/without eval harness → scale via batch PRs across org repos (Primer launch, local run, eval framework, org scaling).Agent sandboxes + traceability as infra primitives: Multiple tweets point to “agent sandboxes” (isolated execution environments) as an emerging January trend (dejavucoder). Cursor proposed an open standard to trace agent conversations to generated code, explicitly positioning it as interoperable across agents/interfaces (Cursor). This pairs with broader ecosystem pressure: agents need auditability and reliable grounding when they can take actions.Multi-agent coordination beats “bigger brain” framing: A popular summary claims a system that uses a controller trained by RL to route between large/small models can beat a single large agent on HLE with lower cost/latency—reinforcing that orchestration policies are becoming first-class artifacts (LiorOnAI). In the same direction, an Amazon “Insight Agents” paper summary argues for pragmatic manager-worker designs with lightweight OOD detection and routing (autoencoder + fine-tuned BERT) instead of LLM-only classifiers for latency/precision reasons (omarsar0).Kimi’s “Agent Swarm” philosophy: A long-form repost from ZhihuFrontier describes K2.5’s agent mode as a response to “text-only helpfulness” and tool-call hallucinations, emphasizing planning→execution bridging, dynamic tool-based context, and multi-viewpoint planning via swarms (ZhihuFrontier).Moltbot/Clawdbot safety trilemma: Community discussion frames “Useful vs Autonomous vs Safe” as a tri-constraint until prompt injection is solved (fabianstelzer). Another take argues capability (trust) bottlenecks dominate: users won’t grant high-stakes autonomy (e.g., finance) until agents are reliably competent (Yuchenj_UW).Model UX, DevTools, and Serving: Gemini Agentic Vision, OpenAI’s in-house data agent, vLLM fixes, and local LLM appsGemini 3 Flash “Agentic Vision”: Google positions Agentic Vision as a structured image-analysis pipeline: planning steps, zooming, annotating, and optionally running Python for plotting—essentially turning “vision” into an agentic workflow rather than a single forward pass (GeminiApp intro, capabilities, rollout note).OpenAI’s in-house data agent at massive scale: OpenAI described an internal “AI data agent” reasoning over 600+ PB and 70k datasets, using Codex-powered table knowledge and careful context management (OpenAIDevs). This is a rare concrete peek at “deep research/data agent” architecture constraints: retrieval + schema/table priors + org context.Serving bugs are still real (vLLM + stateful models): AI21 shared a debugging story where scheduler token allocation caused misclassification between prefill vs decode, now fixed in vLLM v0.14.0—a reminder that infrastructure correctness matters, especially for stateful architectures like Mamba (AI21Labs thread).Local LLM UX continues to improve: Georgi Gerganov shipped LlamaBarn, a tiny macOS menu bar app built on llama.cpp to run local models (ggerganov). Separate comments suggest agentic coding performance may improve by disabling “thinking” modes for specific models (GLM-4.7-Flash) via llama.cpp templates (ggerganov config note).Top tweets (by engagement)Grok Imagine hype &amp; distribution: @elonmusk, @fal, @ArtificialAnlysDeepMind/Google world models: @GoogleDeepMind, @demishassabis, @sundarpichaiAI4Science: @demishassabis on AlphaGenomeSpeech open-source release: @Alibaba_Qwen Qwen3-ASRAgents + developer workflow: @bekacru “Agentic Engineering &gt; Vibe Coding”, @cursor_ai agent-trace.devAnthropic workplace study: @AnthropicAI AI-assisted coding and masteryAI Reddit Recap/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap1. Kimi K2.5 Model Discussions and ReleasesAMA With Kimi, The Open-source Frontier Lab Behind Kimi K2.5 Model (Activity: 686): Kimi is the research lab behind the open-source Kimi K2.5 model, engaging in an AMA to discuss their work. The discussion highlights a focus on large-scale models, with inquiries about the development of smaller models like 8B, 32B, and 70B for better intelligence density. There is also interest in smaller Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, such as ~100B total with ~A3B active, optimized for local or prosumer use. The team is questioned on their stance regarding the notion that Scaling Laws have hit a wall, a topic of current debate in AI research. Commenters express a desire for smaller, more efficient models, suggesting that these could offer better performance for specific use cases. The debate on scaling laws reflects a broader concern in the AI community about the limits of current model scaling strategies.The discussion around model sizes highlights a preference for smaller models like 8B, 32B, and 70B due to their ‘intelligence density.’ These sizes are considered optimal for balancing performance and resource efficiency, suggesting a demand for models that can operate effectively on limited hardware while still providing robust capabilities.The inquiry into smaller Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, such as a ~100B total with ~A3B active, indicates interest in models optimized for local or prosumer use. This reflects a trend towards developing models that are not only powerful but also accessible for individual users or small enterprises, emphasizing the need for efficient resource utilization without sacrificing performance.The challenge of maintaining non-coding abilities like creative writing and emotional intelligence in models like Kimi 2.5 is significant, especially as coding benchmarks become more prominent. The team is tasked with ensuring these softer skills do not regress, which involves balancing the training focus between technical and creative capabilities to meet diverse user needs.Run Kimi K2.5 Locally (Activity: 553): The image provides a guide for running the Kimi-K2.5 model locally, emphasizing its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in vision, coding, agentic, and chat tasks. The model, which is a 1 trillion parameter hybrid reasoning model, requires 600GB of disk space, but the quantized Unsloth Dynamic 1.8-bit version reduces this requirement to 240GB, a 60% reduction. The guide includes instructions for using llama.cpp to load models and demonstrates generating HTML code for a simple game. The model is available on Hugging Face and further documentation can be found on Unsloth’s official site. Commenters discuss the feasibility of running the model on high-end hardware, with one user questioning its performance on a Strix Halo setup and another highlighting the substantial VRAM requirements, suggesting that only a few users can realistically run it locally.Daniel_H212 is inquiring about the performance of the Kimi K2.5 model on the Strix Halo hardware, specifically asking for the token generation speed in seconds per token. This suggests a focus on benchmarking the model’s efficiency on high-end hardware setups.Marksta provides feedback on the quantized version of the Kimi K2.5 model, specifically the Q2_K_XL variant. They note that the model maintains high coherence and adheres strictly to prompts, which is characteristic of Kimi-K2’s style. However, they also mention that while the model’s creative capabilities have improved, it still struggles with execution in creative scenarios, often delivering logical but poorly written responses.MikeRoz questions the utility of higher quantization levels like Q5 and Q6 (e.g., UD-Q5_K_XL, Q6_K) when most experts prefer int4 quantization. This highlights a debate on the trade-offs between model size, performance, and precision in quantization strategies.Kimi K2.5 is the best open model for coding (Activity: 1119): The image highlights Kimi K2.5 as the leading open model for coding on the LMARENA.AI leaderboard, ranked #7 overall. This model is noted for its superior performance in coding tasks compared to other open models. The leaderboard provides a comparative analysis of various AI models, showcasing their ranks, scores, and confidence intervals, emphasizing Kimi K2.5’s achievements in the coding domain. One commenter compared Kimi K2.5’s performance to other models, noting it is on par with Sonnet 4.5 in accuracy but not as advanced as Opus in agentic function. Another comment criticized LMArena for not reflecting a model’s multi-turn or long context capabilities.A user compared Kimi K2.5 to other models, noting that it performs on par with Sonnet 4.5 in terms of accuracy for React projects, but not at the level of Opus in terms of agentic function. They also mentioned that Kimi 2.5 surpasses GLM 4.7, which was their previous choice, and expressed curiosity about the upcoming GLM-5 from z.ai.Another commenter criticized LMArena, stating that it fails to provide insights into a model’s multi-turn, long context, or agentic capabilities, implying that such benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating comprehensive model performance.A user highlighted the cost-effectiveness of Kimi K2.5, stating it feels as competent as Opus 4.5 while being significantly cheaper, approximately 1/5th the cost, and even less expensive than Haiku. This suggests a strong performance-to-cost ratio for Kimi K2.5.Finally We have the best agentic AI at home (Activity: 464): The image is a performance comparison chart of various AI models, including Kimi K2.5, GPT-5.2 (xhigh), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro. Kimi K2.5 is highlighted as the top-performing model across multiple categories such as agents, coding, image, and video tasks, indicating its superior capabilities in multimodal applications. The post suggests excitement about integrating this model with a ‘clawdbot’, hinting at potential applications in robotics or automation. A comment humorously suggests that hosting the Kimi 2.5 1T+ model at home implies having a large home, indicating the model’s likely high computational requirements. Another comment sarcastically mentions handling it with a 16GB VRAM card, implying skepticism about the feasibility of running such a model on typical consumer hardware.2. Open Source Model InnovationsLingBot-World outperforms Genie 3 in dynamic simulation and is fully Open Source (Activity: 230): The open-source framework LingBot-World surpasses the proprietary Genie 3 in dynamic simulation capabilities, achieving 16 FPS and maintaining object consistency for 60 seconds outside the field of view. This model, available on Hugging Face, offers enhanced handling of complex physics and scene transitions, challenging the monopoly of proprietary systems by providing full access to its code and model weights. Commenters question the hardware requirements for running LingBot-World and express skepticism about the comparison with Genie 3, suggesting a lack of empirical evidence or direct access to Genie 3 for a fair comparison.A user questioned the hardware requirements for running LingBot-World, highlighting the importance of specifying computational needs for practical implementation. This is crucial for users to understand the feasibility of deploying the model in various environments.Another commenter raised concerns about the lack of a direct comparison with Genie 3, suggesting that without empirical data or benchmarks, claims of LingBot-World’s superiority might be unsubstantiated. This points to the need for transparent and rigorous benchmarking to validate performance claims.A suggestion was made to integrate a smaller version of LingBot-World into a global illumination stack, indicating potential applications in graphics and rendering. This could leverage the model’s capabilities in dynamic simulation to enhance visual computing tasks.API pricing is in freefall. What’s the actual case for running local now beyond privacy? (Activity: 1053): The post discusses the rapidly decreasing costs of API access for AI models, with examples like K2.5 offering prices at 10% of Opus and Deepseek being nearly free. Gemini also provides a substantial free tier. This trend is contrasted with the challenges of running large models locally, such as the need for expensive GPUs or dealing with quantization tradeoffs, which result in slow processing speeds (15 tok/s) on consumer hardware. The author questions the viability of local setups given these API pricing trends, noting that while privacy and latency control are valid reasons, the cost-effectiveness of local setups is diminishing. Commenters highlight concerns about the sustainability of low API prices, suggesting they may rise once market dominance is achieved, similar to past trends in other industries. Others emphasize the importance of offline capabilities and the ability to audit and trust local models, which ensures consistent behavior without unexpected changes from vendors.Minimum-Vanilla949 highlights the importance of offline capabilities for those who travel frequently, emphasizing the risk of API companies altering terms of service or increasing prices once they dominate the market. This underscores the value of local models for ensuring consistent access and cost control.05032-MendicantBias discusses the unsustainable nature of current API pricing, which is often subsidized by venture capital. They argue that once a monopoly is achieved, prices will likely increase, making local setups and open-source tools a strategic defense against such business models.IactaAleaEst2021 points out the importance of repeatability and trust in using local models. By downloading and auditing a model, users can ensure consistent behavior, unlike APIs where vendors might change model behavior over time, potentially reducing its utility for specific tasks.3. Trends in AI Agent FrameworksGitHub trending this week: half the repos are agent frameworks. 90% will be dead in 1 week. (Activity: 538): The image highlights a trend on GitHub where many of the trending repositories are related to AI agent frameworks, suggesting a surge in interest in these tools. However, the post’s title and comments express skepticism about the sustainability of this trend, comparing it to the rapid rise and fall of JavaScript frameworks. The repositories are mostly written in Python and include a mix of agent frameworks, RAG tooling, and model-related projects like NanoGPT and Grok. The discussion reflects a concern that many of these projects may not maintain their popularity or relevance over time. One comment challenges the claim that half of the trending repositories are agent frameworks, noting that only one is an agent framework by Microsoft, while others are related to RAG tooling and model development. Another comment appreciates the utility of certain projects, like IPTV, for educational purposes.gscjj points out that the claim about ‘half the repos being agent frameworks’ is inaccurate. They note that the list includes a variety of projects such as Microsoft’s agent framework, RAG tooling, and models like NanoGPT and Grok, as well as a model CLI for code named Kimi and a browser API. This suggests a diverse range of trending repositories rather than a dominance of agent frameworks.Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch: “If you treat intelligence as electricity, then you just want to make sure that your access to intelligence cannot be throttled.” (Activity: 357): Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral, advocates for open-weight models, likening intelligence to electricity, emphasizing the importance of unrestricted access to AI capabilities. This approach supports the deployment of models on local devices, reducing costs as models are quantized for lower compute environments, contrasting with closed models that are often large and monetized through paywalls. Mistral aims to balance corporate interests with open access, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in AI deployment. Commenters appreciate Mistral’s approach to open models, noting the potential for reduced costs and increased accessibility. There is a consensus that open models could democratize AI usage, contrasting with the restrictive nature of closed models.RoyalCities highlights the cost dynamics of model deployment, noting that open models, especially when quantized, reduce costs as they can be run on local devices. This contrasts with closed models that are often large and require significant infrastructure, thus being monetized through paywalls. This reflects a broader industry trend where open models aim to democratize access by lowering hardware requirements.HugoCortell points out the hardware bottleneck in deploying open models effectively. While open-source models can rival closed-source ones in performance, the lack of affordable, high-performance hardware limits their accessibility. This is compounded by large companies making high-quality local hardware increasingly expensive, suggesting a need for a company capable of producing and distributing its own hardware to truly democratize AI access.tarruda expresses anticipation for the next open Mistral model, specifically the “8x22”. This indicates a community interest in the technical specifications and potential performance improvements of upcoming models, reflecting the importance of open model development in advancing AI capabilities.Less Technical AI Subreddit Recap/r/Singularity, /r/Oobabooga, /r/MachineLearning, /r/OpenAI, /r/ClaudeAI, /r/StableDiffusion, /r/ChatGPT, /r/ChatGPTCoding, /r/aivideo, /r/aivideo1. OpenAI and AGI InvestmentsNearly half of the Mag 7 are reportedly betting big on OpenAI’s path to AGI (Activity: 1153): NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Amazon are reportedly in discussions to invest a combined total of up to $60 billion into OpenAI, with SoftBank considering an additional $30 billion. This potential investment could value OpenAI at approximately $730 billion pre-money, aligning with recent valuation discussions in the $750 billion to $850 billion+ range. This would mark one of the largest private capital raises in history, highlighting the significant financial commitment from major tech companies towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Commenters note the strategic alignment of these investments, with one pointing out that companies like Microsoft and NVIDIA are unlikely to invest in competitors like Google. Another comment reflects on the evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) and the shifting focus of tech giants.CoolStructure6012 highlights the strategic alignment between Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with OpenAI, suggesting that their investments are logical given their competitive stance against Google. This reflects the broader industry trend where tech giants are aligning with AI leaders to bolster their AI capabilities and market positions.drewc717 reflects on the evolution of AI models, noting a significant productivity boost with OpenAI’s 4.1 Pro mode. However, they express a decline in their workflow efficiency after switching to Gemini, indicating that not all LLMs provide the same level of user experience or productivity, which is crucial for developers relying on these tools.EmbarrassedRing7806 questions the lack of attention on Anthropic despite its widespread use in coding through its Claude model, as opposed to OpenAI’s Codex. This suggests a potential underestimation of Anthropic’s impact in the AI coding space, where Claude might be offering competitive or superior capabilities.2. DeepMind’s AlphaGenome LaunchGoogle DeepMind launches AlphaGenome, an AI model that analyzes up to 1 million DNA bases to predict genomic regulation (Activity: 427): Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaGenome, a sequence model capable of analyzing up to 1 million DNA bases to predict genomic regulation, as detailed in Nature. The model excels in predicting genomic signals such as gene expression and chromatin structure, particularly in non-coding DNA, which is crucial for understanding disease-associated variants. AlphaGenome outperforms existing models on 25 of 26 benchmark tasks and is available for research use, with its model and weights accessible on GitHub. Commenters highlight the model’s potential impact on genomics, with some humorously suggesting its significance in advancing scientific achievements akin to winning Nobel prizes.[R] AlphaGenome: DeepMind’s unified DNA sequence model predicts regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-bp resolution (Nature 2026) (Activity: 66): DeepMind’s AlphaGenome introduces a unified DNA sequence model that predicts regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-base-pair resolution. The model processes 1M base pairs of DNA to predict thousands of functional genomic tracks, matching or exceeding specialized models in 25 of 26 evaluations. It employs a U-Net backbone with CNN and transformer layers, trained on human and mouse genomes, and captures 99% of validated enhancer-gene pairs within a 1Mb context. Training on TPUv3 took 4 hours, with inference under 1 second on H100. The model demonstrates cross-modal variant interpretation, notably on the TAL1 oncogene in T-ALL. Nature, bioRxiv, DeepMind blog, GitHub. Some commenters view the model as an incremental improvement over existing sequence models, questioning the novelty despite its publication in Nature. Others express concerns about the implications of open-sourcing such powerful genomic tools, hinting at potential future applications like ‘text to CRISPR’ models.st8ic88 argues that while DeepMind’s AlphaGenome model is notable for its ability to predict regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-base pair resolution, it is seen as an incremental improvement over existing sequence models predicting genomic tracks. The comment suggests that the model’s prominence is partly due to DeepMind’s reputation and branding, particularly the use of ‘Alpha’ in its name, which may have contributed to its publication in Nature.--MCMC-- is interested in the differences between the AlphaGenome model’s preprint and its final published version in Nature. The commenter had read the preprint and is curious about any changes made during the peer review process, which could include updates to the model’s methodology, results, or interpretations.f0urtyfive raises concerns about the potential risks of open-sourcing powerful genomic models like AlphaGenome, speculating on future developments such as ‘text to CRISPR’ models. This comment highlights the ethical and safety considerations of making advanced genomic prediction tools widely accessible, which could lead to unintended applications or misuse.3. Claude’s Cost Efficiency and Usage StrategiesClaude Subscriptions are up to 36x cheaper than API (and why “Max 5x” is the real sweet spot) (Activity: 665): A data analyst has reverse-engineered Claude’s internal usage limits by analyzing unrounded floats in the web interface, revealing that subscriptions can be up to 36x cheaper than using the API, especially for coding tasks with agents like Claude Code. The analysis shows that the subscription model offers free cache reads, whereas the API charges 10% of the input cost for each read, making the subscription significantly more cost-effective for long sessions. The “Max 5x” plan at $100/month is highlighted as the most optimized, offering a 6x higher session limit and 8.3x higher weekly limit than the Pro plan, contrary to the marketed “5x” and “20x” plans. The findings were derived using the Stern-Brocot tree to decode precise usage percentages into internal credit numbers. Full details and formulas are available here. Commenters express concern over Anthropic’s lack of transparency and speculate that the company might change the limits once they realize users have reverse-engineered them. Some users are taking advantage of the current subscription benefits, anticipating potential changes.HikariWS raises a critical point about Anthropic’s lack of transparency regarding their subscription limits, which could change unexpectedly, rendering current analyses obsolete. This unpredictability poses a risk for developers relying on these plans for cost-effective usage.Isaenkodmitry discusses the potential for Anthropic to close loopholes once they realize users are exploiting subscription plans for cheaper access compared to the API. This highlights a strategic risk for developers who are currently benefiting from these plans, suggesting they should maximize usage while it lasts.Snow30303 mentions using Claude code in VS Code for Flutter apps, noting that it consumes credits rapidly. This suggests a need for more efficient usage strategies or alternative solutions to manage costs effectively when integrating Claude into development workflows.We reduced Claude API costs by 94.5% using a file tiering system (with proof) (Activity: 603): The post describes a file tiering system that reduces Claude API costs by 94.5% by categorizing files into HOT, WARM, and COLD tiers, thus minimizing the number of tokens processed per session. This system, implemented in a tool called cortex-tms, tags files based on their relevance and usage frequency, allowing only the most necessary files to be loaded by default. The approach has been validated through a case study on the author’s project, showing a reduction from 66,834 to 3,647 tokens per session, significantly lowering costs from $0.11 to $0.01 per session with Claude Sonnet 4.5. The tool is open-source and available on GitHub. One commenter inquired about the manual process of tagging files and updating tags, suggesting the use of git history to automate file heat determination. Another user appreciated the approach due to their own struggles with managing API credits.Illustrious-Report96 suggests using git history to determine file ‘heat’, which involves analyzing the frequency and recency of changes to classify files as ‘hot’, ‘warm’, or ‘cold’. This method leverages version control metadata to automate the classification process, potentially reducing manual tagging efforts.Accomplished_Buy9342 inquires about restricting access to ‘WARM’ and ‘COLD’ files, which implies a need for a mechanism to control agent access based on file tier. This could involve implementing access controls or modifying the agent’s logic to prioritize ‘HOT’ files, ensuring efficient resource usage.durable-racoon asks about the process of tagging files and updating these tags, highlighting the importance of an automated or semi-automated system to manage file tiering efficiently. This could involve scripts or tools that dynamically update file tags based on usage patterns or other criteria.</p>"

      "title": "Microsoft Unveils Maia 200, An FP4 and FP8 Optimized AI Inference Accelerator for Azure Datacenters",
      "content": "Maia 200 is Microsoft’s new in house AI accelerator designed for inference in Azure datacenters. It targets the cost of token generation for large language models and other reasoning workloads by combining narrow precision compute, a dense on chip memory hierarchy and an Ethernet based scale up fabric. \n\n\n\nWhy Microsoft built a dedicated inference chip?\n\n\n\nTraining and inference stress hardware in different ways. Training needs very large all to all communication and long running jobs. Inference cares about tokens per second, latency and tokens per dollar. Microsoft positions Maia 200 as its most efficient inference system, with about 30 percent better performance per dollar than the latest hardware in its fleet. \n\n\n\nMaia 200 is part of a heterogeneous Azure stack. It will serve multiple models, including the latest GPT 5.2 models from OpenAI, and will power workloads in Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Microsoft Superintelligence team will use the chip for synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning to improve in house models. \n\n\n\nCore silicon and numeric specifications\n\n\n\nEach Maia 200 die is fabricated on TSMC’s 3 nanometer process. The chip integrates more than 140 billion transistors.\n\n\n\nThe compute pipeline is built around native FP8 and FP4 tensor cores. A single chip delivers more than 10 petaFLOPS in FP4 and more than 5 petaFLOPS in FP8, within a 750W SoC TDP envelope.\n\n\n\nMemory is split between stacked HBM and on die SRAM. Maia 200 provides 216 GB of HBM3e with about 7TB per second of bandwidth and 272MB of on die SRAM. The SRAM is organized into tile level SRAM and cluster level SRAM and is fully software managed. Compilers and runtimes can place working sets explicitly to keep attention and GEMM kernels close to compute.\n\n\n\nTile based microarchitecture and memory hierarchy\n\n\n\nThe Maia 200 microarchitecture is hierarchical. The base unit is the tile. A tile is the smallest autonomous compute and storage unit on the chip. Each tile includes a Tile Tensor Unit for high throughput matrix operations and a Tile Vector Processor as a programmable SIMD engine. Tile SRAM feeds both units and tile DMA engines move data in and out of SRAM without stalling compute. A Tile Control Processor orchestrates the sequence of tensor and DMA work. \n\n\n\nMultiple tiles form a cluster. Each cluster exposes a larger multi banked Cluster SRAM that is shared across tiles in that cluster. Cluster level DMA engines move data between Cluster SRAM and the co packaged HBM stacks. A cluster core coordinates multi tile execution and uses redundancy schemes for tiles and SRAM to improve yield while keeping the same programming model. \n\n\n\nThis hierarchy lets the software stack pin different parts of the model in different tiers. For example, attention kernels can keep Q, K, V tensors in tile SRAM, while collective communication kernels can stage payloads in cluster SRAM and reduce HBM pressure. The design goal is sustained high utilization when models grow in size and sequence length.\n\n\n\nOn chip data movement and Ethernet scale up fabric\n\n\n\nInference is often limited by data movement, not peak compute. Maia 200 uses a custom Network on Chip along with a hierarchy of DMA engines. The Network on Chip spans tiles, clusters, memory controllers and I/O units. It has separate planes for large tensor traffic and for small control messages. This separation keeps synchronization and small outputs from being blocked behind large transfers. \n\n\n\nBeyond the chip boundary, Maia 200 integrates its own NIC and an Ethernet based scale up network that runs the AI Transport Layer protocol. The on-die NIC exposes about 1.4 TB per second in each direction, or 2.8 TB per second bidirectional bandwidth, and scales to 6,144 accelerators in a two tier domain. \n\n\n\nWithin each tray, four Maia accelerators form a Fully Connected Quad. These four devices have direct non switched links to each other. Most tensor parallel traffic stays inside this group, while only lighter collective traffic goes out to switches. This improves latency and reduces switch port count for typical inference collectives. \n\n\n\nAzure system integration and cooling\n\n\n\nAt system level, Maia 200 follows the same rack, power and mechanical standards as Azure GPU servers. It supports air cooled and liquid cooled configurations and uses a second generation closed loop liquid cooling Heat Exchanger Unit for high density racks. This allows mixed deployments of GPUs and Maia accelerators in the same datacenter footprint.\n\n\n\nThe accelerator integrates with the Azure control plane. Firmware management, health monitoring and telemetry use the same workflows as other Azure compute services. This enables fleet wide rollouts and maintenance without disrupting running AI workloads. \n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\nHere are 5 concise, technical takeaways:\n\n\n\n\nInference first design: Maia 200 is Microsoft’s first silicon and system platform built only for AI inference, optimized for large scale token generation in modern reasoning models and large language models.\n\n\n\nNumeric specs and memory hierarchy: The chip is fabricated on TSMCs 3nm, integrates about 140 billion transistors and delivers more than 10 PFLOPS FP4 and more than 5 PFLOPS FP8, with 216 GB HBM3e at 7TB per second along with 272 MB on chip SRAM split into tile SRAM and cluster SRAM and managed in software. \n\n\n\nPerformance versus other cloud accelerators: Microsoft reports about 30 percent better performance per dollar than the latest Azure inference systems and claims 3 times FP4 performance of third generation Amazon Trainium and higher FP8 performance than Google TPU v7 at the accelerator level.\n\n\n\nTile based architecture and Ethernet fabric: Maia 200 organizes compute into tiles and clusters with local SRAM, DMA engines and a Network on Chip, and exposes an integrated NIC with about 1.4 TB per second per direction Ethernet bandwidth that scales to 6,144 accelerators using Fully Connected Quad groups as the local tensor parallel domain.\n\nThe post Microsoft Unveils Maia 200, An FP4 and FP8 Optimized AI Inference Accelerator for Azure Datacenters appeared first on MarkTechPost.",

      "title": "AI2 Releases SERA, Soft Verified Coding Agents Built with Supervised Training Only for Practical Repository Level Automation Workflows",
      "content": "Allen Institute for AI (AI2) Researchers introduce SERA, Soft Verified Efficient Repository Agents, as a coding agent family that aims to match much larger closed systems using only supervised training and synthetic trajectories.\n\n\n\nWhat is SERA?\n\n\n\nSERA is the first release in AI2’s Open Coding Agents series. The flagship model, SERA-32B, is built on the Qwen 3 32B architecture and is trained as a repository level coding agent.\n\n\n\nOn SWE bench Verified at 32K context, SERA-32B reaches 49.5 percent resolve rate. At 64K context it reaches 54.2 percent. These numbers place it in the same performance band as open weight systems such as Devstral-Small-2 with 24B parameters and GLM-4.5 Air with 110B parameters, while SERA remains fully open in code, data, and weights.\n\n\n\nThe series includes four models today, SERA-8B, SERA-8B GA, SERA-32B, and SERA-32B GA. All are released on Hugging Face under an Apache 2.0 license.\n\n\n\nSoft Verified Generation\n\n\n\nThe training pipeline relies on Soft Verified Generation, SVG. SVG produces agent trajectories that look like realistic developer workflows, then uses patch agreement between two rollouts as a soft signal of correctness.\n\n\n\nThe process is:\n\n\n\n\nFirst rollout: A function is sampled from a real repository. The teacher model, GLM-4.6 in the SERA-32B setup, receives a bug style or change description and operates with tools to view files, edit code, and run commands. It produces a trajectory T1 and a patch P1.\n\n\n\nSynthetic pull request: The system converts the trajectory into a pull request like description. This text summarizes intent and key edits in a format similar to real pull requests.\n\n\n\nSecond rollout: The teacher starts again from the original repository, but now it only sees the pull request description and the tools. It produces a new trajectory T2 and patch P2 that tries to implement the described change.\n\n\n\nSoft verification: The patches P1 and P2 are compared line by line. A recall score r is computed as the fraction of modified lines in P1 that appear in P2. When r equals 1 the trajectory is hard verified. For intermediate values, the sample is soft verified.\n\n\n\n\nThe key result from the ablation study is that strict verification is not required. When models are trained on T2 trajectories with different thresholds on r, even r equals 0, performance on SWE bench Verified is similar at a fixed sample count. This suggests that realistic multi step traces, even if noisy, are valuable supervision for coding agents.\n\n\n\nhttps://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents\n\n\nData scale, training, and cost\n\n\n\nSVG is applied to 121 Python repositories derived from the SWE-smith corpus. Across GLM-4.5 Air and GLM-4.6 teacher runs, the full SERA datasets contain more than 200,000 trajectories from both rollouts, making this one of the largest open coding agent datasets.\n\n\n\nSERA-32B is trained on a subset of 25,000 T2 trajectories from the Sera-4.6-Lite T2 dataset. Training uses standard supervised fine tuning with Axolotl on Qwen-3-32B for 3 epochs, learning rate 1e-5, weight decay 0.01, and maximum sequence length 32,768 tokens.\n\n\n\nMany trajectories are longer than the context limit. The research team define a truncation ratio, the fraction of steps that fit into 32K tokens. They then prefer trajectories that already fit, and for the rest they select slices with high truncation ratio. This ordered truncation strategy clearly outperforms random truncation when they compare SWE bench Verified scores.\n\n\n\nThe reported compute budget for SERA-32B, including data generation and training, is about 40 GPU days. Using a scaling law over dataset size and performance, the research team estimated that the SVG approach is around 26 times cheaper than reinforcement learning based systems such as SkyRL-Agent and 57 times cheaper than earlier synthetic data pipelines such as SWE-smith for reaching similar SWE-bench scores.\n\n\n\nhttps://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents\n\n\nRepository specialization\n\n\n\nA central use case is adapting an agent to a specific repository. The research team studies this on three major SWE-bench Verified projects, Django, SymPy, and Sphinx.\n\n\n\nFor each repository, SVG generates on the order of 46,000 to 54,000 trajectories. Due to compute limits, the specialization experiments train on 8,000 trajectories per repository, mixing 3,000 soft verified T2 trajectories with 5,000 filtered T1 trajectories.\n\n\n\nAt 32K context, these specialized students match or slightly outperform the GLM-4.5-Air teacher, and also compare well with Devstral-Small-2 on those repository subsets.

      "content_html": "<p>Allen Institute for AI (AI2) Researchers introduce SERA, Soft Verified Efficient Repository Agents, as a coding agent family that aims to match much larger closed systems using only supervised training and synthetic trajectories.</p>\n<p>What is SERA?</p>\n<p>SERA is the first release in AI2’s Open Coding Agents series. The flagship model, SERA-32B, is built on the Qwen 3 32B architecture and is trained as a repository level coding agent.</p>\n<p>On SWE bench Verified at 32K context, SERA-32B reaches 49.5 percent resolve rate. At 64K context it reaches 54.2 percent. These numbers place it in the same performance band as open weight systems such as Devstral-Small-2 with 24B parameters and GLM-4.5 Air with 110B parameters, while SERA remains fully open in code, data, and weights.</p>\n<p>The series includes four models today, SERA-8B, SERA-8B GA, SERA-32B, and SERA-32B GA. All are released on Hugging Face under an Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n<p>Soft Verified Generation</p>\n<p>The training pipeline relies on Soft Verified Generation, SVG. SVG produces agent trajectories that look like realistic developer workflows, then uses patch agreement between two rollouts as a soft signal of correctness.</p>\n<p>The process is:</p>\n<p>First rollout: A function is sampled from a real repository. The teacher model, GLM-4.6 in the SERA-32B setup, receives a bug style or change description and operates with tools to view files, edit code, and run commands. It produces a trajectory T1 and a patch P1.</p>\n<p>Synthetic pull request: The system converts the trajectory into a pull request like description. This text summarizes intent and key edits in a format similar to real pull requests.</p>\n<p>Second rollout: The teacher starts again from the original repository, but now it only sees the pull request description and the tools. It produces a new trajectory T2 and patch P2 that tries to implement the described change.</p>\n<p>Soft verification: The patches P1 and P2 are compared line by line. A recall score r is computed as the fraction of modified lines in P1 that appear in P2. When r equals 1 the trajectory is hard verified. For intermediate values, the sample is soft verified.</p>\n<p>The key result from the ablation study is that strict verification is not required. When models are trained on T2 trajectories with different thresholds on r, even r equals 0, performance on SWE bench Verified is similar at a fixed sample count. This suggests that realistic multi step traces, even if noisy, are valuable supervision for coding agents.</p>\n<p>https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents</p>\n<p>Data scale, training, and cost</p>\n<p>SVG is applied to 121 Python repositories derived from the SWE-smith corpus. Across GLM-4.5 Air and GLM-4.6 teacher runs, the full SERA datasets contain more than 200,000 trajectories from both rollouts, making this one of the largest open coding agent datasets.</p>\n<p>SERA-32B is trained on a subset of 25,000 T2 trajectories from the Sera-4.6-Lite T2 dataset. Training uses standard supervised fine tuning with Axolotl on Qwen-3-32B for 3 epochs, learning rate 1e-5, weight decay 0.01, and maximum sequence length 32,768 tokens.</p>\n<p>Many trajectories are longer than the context limit. The research team define a truncation ratio, the fraction of steps that fit into 32K tokens. They then prefer trajectories that already fit, and for the rest they select slices with high truncation ratio. This ordered truncation strategy clearly outperforms random truncation when they compare SWE bench Verified scores.</p>\n<p>The reported compute budget for SERA-32B, including data generation and training, is about 40 GPU days. Using a scaling law over dataset size and performance, the research team estimated that the SVG approach is around 26 times cheaper than reinforcement learning based systems such as SkyRL-Agent and 57 times cheaper than earlier synthetic data pipelines such as SWE-smith for reaching similar SWE-bench scores.</p>\n<p>https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents</p>\n<p>Repository specialization</p>\n<p>A central use case is adapting an agent to a specific repository. The research team studies this on three major SWE-bench Verified projects, Django, SymPy, and Sphinx.</p>\n<p>For each repository, SVG generates on the order of 46,000 to 54,000 trajectories. Due to compute limits, the specialization experiments train on 8,000 trajectories per repository, mixing 3,000 soft verified T2 trajectories with 5,000 filtered T1 trajectories.</p>\n<p>At 32K context, these specialized students match or slightly outperform the GLM-4.5-Air teacher, and also compare well with Devstral-Small-2 on those repository subsets. For Django, a specialized student reaches 52.23 percent resolve rate versus 51.20 percent for GLM-4.5-Air. For SymPy, the specialized model reaches 51.11 percent versus 48.89 percent for GLM-4.5-Air.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>SERA turns coding agents into a supervised learning problem: SERA-32B is trained with standard supervised fine tuning on synthetic trajectories from GLM-4.6, with no reinforcement learning loop and no dependency on repository test suites.</p>\n<p>Soft Verified Generation removes the need for tests: SVG uses two rollouts and patch overlap between P1 and P2 to compute a soft verification score, and the research team show that even unverified or weakly verified trajectories can train effective coding agents.</p>\n<p>Large, realistic agent dataset from real repositories: The pipeline applies SVG to 121 Python projects from the SWE smith corpus, producing more than 200,000 trajectories and creating one of the largest open datasets for coding agents.</p>\n<p>Efficient training with explicit cost and scaling analysis: SERA-32B trains on 25,000 T2 trajectories and the scaling study shows that SVG is about 26 times cheaper than SkyRL-Agent and 57 times cheaper than SWE-smith at similar SWE bench Verified performance.</p>\n<p>Check out the&nbsp;Paper, Repo and Model Weights.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;feel free to follow us on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and don’t forget to join our&nbsp;100k+ ML SubReddit&nbsp;and Subscribe to&nbsp;our Newsletter.

      "title": "DeepSeek AI Releases DeepSeek-OCR 2 with Causal Visual Flow Encoder for Layout Aware Document Understanding",
      "content": "DeepSeek AI released DeepSeek-OCR 2, an open source document OCR and understanding system that restructures its vision encoder to read pages in a causal order that is closer to how humans scan complex documents. The key component is DeepEncoder V2, a language model style transformer that converts a 2D page into a 1D sequence of visual tokens that already follow a learned reading flow before text decoding starts.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2\n\n\nFrom raster order to causal visual flow\n\n\n\nMost multimodal models still flatten images into a fixed raster sequence, top left to bottom right, and apply a transformer with static positional encodings. This is a poor match for documents with multi column layouts, nested tables, and mixed language regions. Human readers instead follow a semantic order that jumps between regions.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-OCR 2 keeps the encoder and decoder structure of DeepSeek-OCR, but replaces the original CLIP ViT based visual encoder with DeepEncoder V2. The decoder remains DeepSeek-3B-A500M, a MoE language model with about 3B total parameters and about 500M active parameters per token. The goal is to let the encoder perform causal reasoning over visual tokens and to hand the decoder a sequence that is already aligned with a likely reading order.\n\n\n\nVision tokenizer and token budget\n\n\n\nThe vision tokenizer is inherited from DeepSeek-OCR. It uses an 80M parameter SAM base backbone followed by 2 convolution layers. This stage downsamples the image so that the visual token count is reduced by a factor of 16 and compresses features into an embedding dimension of 896.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-OCR 2 uses a global and local multi crop strategy to cover dense pages without letting the token count explode. A global view at 1024 × 1024 resolution produces 256 tokens. Up to 6 local crops at 768 × 768 resolution add 144 tokens each. As a result, the visual token count ranges from 256 to 1120 per page. This upper bound is slightly smaller than the 1156 token budget used in the original DeepSeek-OCR&#8217;s Gundam mode, and it is comparable to the budget used by Gemini-3 Pro on OmniDocBench.\n\n\n\nDeepEncoder-V2, language model as vision encoder\n\n\n\nDeepEncoder-V2 is built by instantiating a Qwen2-0.5B style transformer as the vision encoder. The input sequence is constructed as follows. First, all visual tokens from the tokenizer form the prefix. Then a set of learnable query tokens, called causal flow tokens, is appended as the suffix. The number of causal flow tokens equals the number of visual tokens.\n\n\n\nThe attention pattern is asymmetric. Visual tokens use bidirectional attention and see all other visual tokens. Causal flow tokens use causal attention and can see all visual tokens and only previous causal flow tokens. Only the outputs at causal flow positions are passed to the decoder. In effect, the encoder learns a mapping from a 2D grid of visual tokens into a 1D causal sequence of flow tokens that encode a proposed reading order and local context.\n\n\n\nThis design decomposes the problem into 2 stages. DeepEncoder-V2 performs causal reasoning over visual structure and reading order. DeepSeek-3B-A500M then performs causal decoding over text conditioned on this reordered visual input.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2\n\n\nTraining pipeline\n\n\n\nThe training data pipeline follows DeepSeek-OCR and focuses on OCR intensive content. OCR data accounts for 80 percent of the mixture. The research team rebalances the sampling across text, formulas, and tables using a 3:1:1 ratio so that the model sees enough structure heavy examples.\n\n\n\nTraining runs in 3 stages:\n\n\n\nIn stage 1, encoder pretraining couples DeepEncoder-V2 to a small decoder and uses a standard language modeling objective. The model is trained at 768×768 and 1024×1024 resolutions with multi scale sampling. The vision tokenizer is initialized from the original DeepEncoder. The LLM style encoder is initialized from Qwen2-0.5B base. The optimizer is AdamW with cosine learning rate decay from 1e-4 to 1e-6 over 40k iterations. Training uses about 160 A100 GPUs, sequence length 8k with packing, and a large mixture of document image text samples.\n\n\n\nIn stage 2, query enhancement attaches DeepEncoder-V2 to DeepSeek-3B-A500M and introduces multi crop views. The tokenizer is frozen. The encoder and decoder are jointly trained with 4 stage pipeline parallelism and 40 data parallel replicas. The global batch size is 1280 and the schedule runs for 15k iterations with learning rate decay from 5e-5 to 1e-6.\n\n\n\nIn stage 3, all encoder parameters are frozen. Only the DeepSeek decoder is trained to better adapt to the reordered visual tokens. This stage uses the same batch size but a shorter schedule and a lower learning rate that decays from 1e-6 to 5e-8 over 20k iterations. Freezing the encoder more than doubles training throughput at this stage.\n\n\n\nBenchmark results on OmniDocBench\n\n\n\nThe main evaluation uses OmniDocBench-v1.5. This benchmark contains 1355 pages in 9 document categories in Chinese and English, including books, academic papers, forms, presentations, and newspapers. Each page is annotated with layout elements such as text spans, equations, tables, and figures.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-OCR 2 achieves an overall OmniDocBench score of 91.09 with a visual token maximum of 1120. The original DeepSeek-OCR baseline scores 87.36 with a token maximum of 1156. DeepSeek-OCR 2 therefore gains 3.73 points while using a slightly smaller token budget.\n\n\n\nReading order (R-order) Edit Distance, which measures the difference between predicted and ground truth reading sequences, drops from 0.085 to 0.057. Text edit distance falls from 0.073 to 0.048. Formula and table edit distances also decrease, which indicates better parsing of math and structured regions.\n\n\n\nViewed as a document parser, DeepSeek-OCR-2 achieves overall element level edit distance 0.100. The original DeepSeek-OCR reaches 0.129 and Gemini-3 Pro reaches 0.115 under similar visual token constraints. This suggests that the causal visual flow encoder improves structural fidelity without expanding the token budget.\n\n\n\nCategory wise, DeepSeek-OCR-2 improves text edit distance for most document types, such as academic papers and books. Performance is weaker on very dense newspapers, where text edit distance remains above 0.13. The research team link this to limited training data for newspapers and heavy compression on extreme text density. Reading order metrics, however, improve across all categories.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-OCR 2 replaces a CLIP ViT style encoder with DeepEncoder-V2, a Qwen2-0.5B based language model encoder that converts a 2D document page into a 1D sequence of causal flow tokens aligned with a learned reading order.\n\n\n\nThe vision tokenizer uses an 80M parameter SAM base backbone with convolutions, multi crop global and local views, and keeps the visual token budget between 256 and 1120 tokens per page, slightly below the original DeepSeek-OCR Gundam mode while remaining comparable to Gemini 3 Pro.\n\n\n\nTraining follows a 3 stage pipeline, encoder pretraining, joint query enhancement with DeepSeek-3B-A500M, and decoder only fine-tuning with the encoder frozen, using an OCR heavy data mix with 80 percent OCR data and a 3 to 1 to 1 sampling ratio over text, formulas, and tables.\n\n\n\nOn OmniDocBench v1.5 with 1355 pages and 9 document categories, DeepSeek-OCR 2 reaches an overall score of 91.09 versus 87.36 for DeepSeek-OCR, reduces reading order edit distance from 0.085 to 0.057, and achieves element level edit distance 0.100 compared with 0.129 for DeepSeek-OCR and 0.115 for Gemini-3 Pro under similar visual token budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Paper, Repo and Model weights. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content": "How do you build a single vision language action model that can control many different dual arm robots in the real world? LingBot-VLA is Ant Group Robbyant’s new Vision Language Action foundation model that targets practical robot manipulation in the real world. It is trained on about 20,000 hours of teleoperated bimanual data collected from 9 dual arm robot embodiments and is evaluated on the large scale GM-100 benchmark across 3 platforms. The model is designed for cross morphology generalization, data efficient post training, and high training throughput on commodity GPU clusters.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18692\n\n\nLarge scale dual arm dataset across 9 robot embodiments\n\n\n\nThe pre-training dataset is built from real world teleoperation on 9 popular dual arm configurations. These include AgiBot G1, AgileX, Galaxea R1Lite, Galaxea R1Pro, Realman Rs 02, Leju KUAVO 4 Pro, Qinglong humanoid, ARX Lift2, and a Bimanual Franka setup. All systems have dual 6 or 7 degree of freedom arms with parallel grippers and multiple RGB-D cameras that provide multi view observations\n\n\n\nTeleoperation uses VR control for AgiBot G1 and isomorphic arm control for AgileX. For each scene the recorded videos from all views are segmented by human annotators into clips that correspond to atomic actions. Static frames at the start and end of each clip are removed to reduce redundancy. Task level and sub task level language instructions are then generated with Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B. This pipeline yields synchronized sequences of images, instructions, and action trajectories for pre-training.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo characterize action diversity the research team visualizes the most frequent atomic actions in training and tests through word clouds. About 50 percent of atomic actions in the test set do not appear within the top 100 most frequent actions in the training set. This gap ensures that evaluation stresses cross task generalization rather than frequency based memorization.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18692\n\n\nArchitecture, Mixture of Transformers, and Flow Matching actions\n\n\n\nLingBot-VLA combines a strong multimodal backbone with an action expert through a Mixture of Transformers architecture. The vision language backbone is Qwen2.5-VL. It encodes multi-view operational images and the natural language instruction into a sequence of multimodal tokens. In parallel, the action expert receives robot proprioceptive state and chunks of past actions. Both branches share a self attention module that performs layer wise joint sequence modeling over observation and action tokens.\n\n\n\nAt each time step the model forms an observation sequence that concatenates tokens from 3 camera views, the task instruction, and the robot state. The action sequence is a future action chunk with a temporal horizon set to 50 during pre-training. The training objective is conditional Flow Matching. The model learns a vector field that transports Gaussian noise to the ground truth action trajectory along a linear probability path. This gives a continuous action representation and produces smooth, temporally coherent control suitable for precise dual arm manipulation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLingBot-VLA uses blockwise causal attention over the joint sequence. Observation tokens can attend to each other bidirectionally. Action tokens can attend to all observation tokens and only to past action tokens. This mask prevents information leakage from future actions into current observations while still allowing the action expert to exploit the full multimodal context at each decision step.\n\n\n\nSpatial perception via LingBot Depth distillation\n\n\n\nMany VLA models struggle with depth reasoning when depth sensors fail or return sparse measurements. LingBot-VLA addresses this by integrating LingBot-Depth, a separate spatial perception model based on Masked Depth Modeling. LingBot-Depth is trained in a self supervised way on a large RGB-D corpus and learns to reconstruct dense metric depth when parts of the depth map are masked, often in regions where physical sensors tend to fail.\n\n\n\nIn LingBot-VLA the visual queries from each camera view are aligned with LingBot-Depth tokens through a projection layer and a distillation loss. Cross attention maps VLM queries into the depth latent space and the training minimizes their difference from LingBot-Depth features. This injects geometry aware information into the policy and improves performance on tasks that require accurate 3D spatial reasoning, such as insertion, stacking, and folding under clutter and occlusion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGM-100 real world benchmark across 3 platforms\n\n\n\nThe main evaluation uses GM-100, a real world benchmark with 100 manipulation tasks and 130 filtered teleoperated trajectories per task on each of 3 hardware platforms. Experiments compare LingBot-VLA with π0.5, GR00T N1.6, and WALL-OSS under a shared post training protocol. All methods fine tune from public checkpoints with the same dataset, batch size 256, and 20 epochs. Success Rate measures completion of all subtasks within 3 minutes and Progress Score tracks partial completion.\n\n\n\nOn GM-100, LingBot-VLA with depth achieves state of the art averages across the 3 platforms. The average Success Rate is 17.30 percent and the average Progress Score is 35.41 percent. π0.5 reaches 13.02 percent SR (success rate) and 27.65 percent PS (progress score). GR00T N1.6 and WALL-OSS are lower at 7.59 percent SR, 15.99 percent PS and 4.05 percent SR, 10.35 percent PS respectively. LingBot-VLA without depth already outperforms GR00T N1.6 and WALL-OSS and the depth variant adds further gains.\n\n\n\nIn RoboTwin 2.0 simulation with 50 tasks, models are trained on 50 demonstrations per task in clean scenes and 500 per task in randomized scenes. LingBot-VLA with depth reaches 88.56 percent average Success Rate in clean scenes and 86.68 percent in randomized scenes. π0.5 reaches 82.74 percent and 76.76 percent in the same settings. This shows consistent gains from the same architecture and depth integration when domain randomization is strong.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18692\n\n\nScaling behavior and data efficient post training\n\n\n\nThe research team analyzes scaling laws by varying pre-training data from 3,000 to 20,000 hours on a subset of 25 tasks. Both Success Rate and Progress Score increase monotonically with data volume, with no saturation at the largest scale studied. This is the first empirical evidence that VLA models maintain favorable scaling on real robot data at this size.\n\n\n\nThey also study data efficiency of post training on AgiBot G1 using 8 representative GM-100 tasks. With only 80 demonstrations per task LingBot-VLA already surpasses π0.5 that uses the full 130 demonstration set, in both Success Rate and Progress Score. As more trajectories are added the performance gap widens. This confirms that the pre-trained policy transfers with only dozens to around 100 task specific trajectories, which directly reduces adaptation cost for new robots or tasks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTraining throughput and open source toolkit\n\n\n\nLingBot-VLA comes with a training stack optimized for multi-node efficiency. The codebase uses a FSDP style strategy for parameters and optimizer states, hybrid sharding for the action expert, mixed precision with float32 reductions and bfloat16 storage, and operator level acceleration with fused attention kernels and torch compile.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn an 8 GPU setup the research team reported throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU for Qwen2.5-VL-3B and PaliGemma-3B-pt-224 model configurations. This corresponds to a 1.5 times to 2.8 times speedup compared with existing VLA oriented codebases such as StarVLA, Dexbotic, and OpenPI evaluated on the same Libero based benchmark. Throughput scales close to linearly when moving from 8 to 256 GPUs. The full post training toolkit is released as open source.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nLingBot-VLA is a Qwen2.5-VL based vision language action foundation model trained on about 20,000 hours of real world dual arm teleoperation across 9 robot embodiments, which enables strong cross morphology and cross task generalization.\n\n\n\nThe model integrates LingBot Depth through feature distillation so vision tokens are aligned with a depth completion expert, which significantly improves 3D spatial understanding for insertion, stacking, folding, and other geometry sensitive tasks.\n\n\n\nOn the GM-100 real world benchmark, LingBot-VLA with depth achieves about 17.30 percent average Success Rate and 35.41 percent average Progress Score, which is higher than π0.5, GR00T N1.6, and WALL OSS under the same post training protocol.\n\n\n\nLingBot-VLA shows high data efficiency in post training, since on AgiBot G1 it can surpass π0.5 that uses 130 demonstrations per task while using only about 80 demonstrations per task, and performance continues to improve as more trajectories are added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Paper, Model Weight, Repo and Project Page. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content": "The artificial intelligence industry&#8217;s pivot toward agentic AI – systems capable of autonomously executing multi-step tasks – has dominated technology discussions in recent months.\nBut while Western firms focus on foundational models and cross-platform interoperability, China&#8217;s technology giants are racing to dominate through commerce integration, a divergence that could reshape how enterprises deploy autonomous systems globally.\nAlibaba, Tencent and ByteDance have rapidly upgraded their AI platforms to support agentic commerce, marking a pivot from conversational AI tools to agents capable of completing entire transaction cycles, from product discovery through payment.\nJust last week, Alibaba upgraded its Qwen chatbot to let direct transaction completion in the interface, connecting the AI agent in its ecosystem, including Taobao, Alipay, Amap and travel platform Fliggy. The integration supports over 400 core digital tasks, allowing users to compare personalised recommendations in platforms and complete payments without leaving the chatbot environment.\n&#8220;The agentic transformation of commercial services lets the maximal integration of user services and enhances user stickiness,&#8221; Shaochen Wang, research analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC, referring to stronger long-term user engagement that creates sustainable competitive advantages.\nThe super app advantage\nBefore that, ByteDance upgraded its Doubao AI chatbot in December to autonomously handle tasks, including ticket bookings, through integrations with Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. The upgraded model was introduced on a ZTE-developed prototype smartphone as a system-level AI assistant; however, some planned features were later scaled back due to privacy and security concerns raised by rivals.\nTencent President Martin Lau indicated during the company&#8217;s May 2025 earnings call that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem, which serves over one billion users with integrated messaging, payments, e-commerce and services.\nThe positioning reflects China&#8217;s structural advantage in agentic AI deployment: integrated ecosystems that eliminate the fragmentation constraining Western competitors.\n&#8220;AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration in payments, logistics, and social engagement,&#8221; Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told CNBC. &#8220;Chinese firms like Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioural data, and consumer familiarity with super apps.&#8221;\nWestern companies face more fragmented data environments and stricter privacy regulations that slow cross-service integration, despite leading in foundational AI model development and global reach, Dai noted.\nAgentic AI&#8217;s enterprise trajectory\nCommercial applications signal broader enterprise implications as agentic AI moves from auxiliary tools to autonomous actors capable of executing complex workflows. Industry experts expect multi-agent systems to emerge as a defining trend in AI deployment this year, extending from consumer services into organisational production.\nIn a report by Global Times, Tian Feng, president of the Fast Think Institute and former dean of SenseTime&#8217;s Intelligence Industry Research Institute, predicted that the first AI agent to surpass 300 million monthly active users could emerge as early as 2026, becoming &#8220;an indispensable assistant for work and daily life&#8221; capable of autonomously executing cross-app, composite services.\nApproximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a 2025 McKinsey study. The research firm estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for US businesses by 2030 through streamlining routine steps in consumer decision-making.\nChinese cloud providers, including smaller players like JD Cloud and UCloud, have also begun supporting agentic AI tools, though high token use has driven some providers, like ByteDance&#8217;s Volcano Engine, to introduce fixed-subscription pricing models to address cost concerns.\nDivergent deployment strategies\nThe contrasting approaches between Chinese integration and Western scalability reflect fundamental differences in market structure and regulatory environments that will likely define competitive positioning.\n&#8220;China will prioritise domestic integration and expansion in selected regions, while US firms focus on global scalability and governance,&#8221; Dai said.\nUS players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and Amazon, while Google explores positioning itself as a &#8220;matchmaker&#8221; between merchants, consumers and AI agents – approaches that reflect fragmented platform environments requiring interoperability not closed-loop integration.\nHowever, the autonomous nature of agentic systems has raised regulatory questions in China. ByteDance warned users about security and privacy risks when announcing Doubao&#8217;s abilities, recommending deployment on dedicated devices not those containing sensitive information, given the tool&#8217;s access to device data, digital accounts and internet connectivity in multiple ports.\nThe rapid commercialisation of agentic AI in China&#8217;s consumer sector provides enterprise decision-makers globally with early signals of how autonomous systems may reshape customer acquisition costs, platform economics and competitive moats as these abilities mature.\n(Photo by Philip Oroni)\nSee also: Deloitte sounds alarm as AI agent deployment outruns safety frameworks\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "content_html": "<p>The artificial intelligence industry’s pivot toward agentic AI – systems capable of autonomously executing multi-step tasks – has dominated technology discussions in recent months.</p>\n<p>But while Western firms focus on foundational models and cross-platform interoperability, China’s technology giants are racing to dominate through commerce integration, a divergence that could reshape how enterprises deploy autonomous systems globally.</p>\n<p>Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance have rapidly upgraded their AI platforms to support agentic commerce, marking a pivot from conversational AI tools to agents capable of completing entire transaction cycles, from product discovery through payment.</p>\n<p>Just last week, Alibaba upgraded its Qwen chatbot to let direct transaction completion in the interface, connecting the AI agent in its ecosystem, including Taobao, Alipay, Amap and travel platform Fliggy. The integration supports over 400 core digital tasks, allowing users to compare personalised recommendations in platforms and complete payments without leaving the chatbot environment.</p>\n<p>“The agentic transformation of commercial services lets the maximal integration of user services and enhances user stickiness,” Shaochen Wang, research analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC, referring to stronger long-term user engagement that creates sustainable competitive advantages.</p>\n<p>The super app advantage</p>\n<p>Before that, ByteDance upgraded its Doubao AI chatbot in December to autonomously handle tasks, including ticket bookings, through integrations with Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. The upgraded model was introduced on a ZTE-developed prototype smartphone as a system-level AI assistant; however, some planned features were later scaled back due to privacy and security concerns raised by rivals.</p>\n<p>Tencent President Martin Lau indicated during the company’s May 2025 earnings call that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem, which serves over one billion users with integrated messaging, payments, e-commerce and services.</p>\n<p>The positioning reflects China’s structural advantage in agentic AI deployment: integrated ecosystems that eliminate the fragmentation constraining Western competitors.</p>\n<p>“AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration in payments, logistics, and social engagement,” Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told CNBC. “Chinese firms like Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioural data, and consumer familiarity with super apps.”</p>\n<p>Western companies face more fragmented data environments and stricter privacy regulations that slow cross-service integration, despite leading in foundational AI model development and global reach, Dai noted.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI’s enterprise trajectory</p>\n<p>Commercial applications signal broader enterprise implications as agentic AI moves from auxiliary tools to autonomous actors capable of executing complex workflows. Industry experts expect multi-agent systems to emerge as a defining trend in AI deployment this year, extending from consumer services into organisational production.</p>\n<p>In a report by Global Times, Tian Feng, president of the Fast Think Institute and former dean of SenseTime’s Intelligence Industry Research Institute, predicted that the first AI agent to surpass 300 million monthly active users could emerge as early as 2026, becoming “an indispensable assistant for work and daily life” capable of autonomously executing cross-app, composite services.</p>\n<p>Approximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a 2025 McKinsey study. The research firm estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for US businesses by 2030 through streamlining routine steps in consumer decision-making.</p>\n<p>Chinese cloud providers, including smaller players like JD Cloud and UCloud, have also begun supporting agentic AI tools, though high token use has driven some providers, like ByteDance’s Volcano Engine, to introduce fixed-subscription pricing models to address cost concerns.</p>\n<p>Divergent deployment strategies</p>\n<p>The contrasting approaches between Chinese integration and Western scalability reflect fundamental differences in market structure and regulatory environments that will likely define competitive positioning.</p>\n<p>“China will prioritise domestic integration and expansion in selected regions, while US firms focus on global scalability and governance,” Dai said.</p>\n<p>US players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and Amazon, while Google explores positioning itself as a “matchmaker” between merchants, consumers and AI agents – approaches that reflect fragmented platform environments requiring interoperability not closed-loop integration.</p>\n<p>However, the autonomous nature of agentic systems has raised regulatory questions in China. ByteDance warned users about security and privacy risks when announcing Doubao’s abilities, recommending deployment on dedicated devices not those containing sensitive information, given the tool’s access to device data, digital accounts and internet connectivity in multiple ports.</p>\n<p>The rapid commercialisation of agentic AI in China’s consumer sector provides enterprise decision-makers globally with early signals of how autonomous systems may reshape customer acquisition costs, platform economics and competitive moats as these abilities mature.</p>\n<p>(Photo by Philip Oroni)</p>\n<p>See also: Deloitte sounds alarm as AI agent deployment outruns safety frameworks</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?
