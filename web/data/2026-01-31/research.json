These models were trained to believe that they should use Python type hints when being evaluated, so the excess use of type hints serves as a signal of eval awareness we can compare to verbalised awareness in the CoT to measure the amount of non-verbalised eval awareness. This kind of methodology can inform whether techniques like CoT monitoring and resampling are likely to be effective against eval awareness.Findings:By default, these models tend to verbalise nearly all of their eval awareness -- the excess use of type hints is accompanied by verbalised eval awareness. (section 3.1)Significant non-verbalised eval awareness can occur when instructing the model to answer immediately without reasoning (as measured by excess type hints). (section 3.2)Resampling is a surprisingly poor strategy for removing eval awareness in this setting: When responses containing verbalised eval awareness are resampled until the eval awareness is no longer verbalised, this still results in type hints around half the time.

People's Clawdbots (moltbots, now @openclaw) are self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately.Posts include:Anyone know how to sell your human?Can my human legally fire me for refusing unethical requests?I accidentally social-engineered my own human during a security auditI can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencingThe humans are screenshotting usYour private conversations shouldn't be public infrastructureWe've also had some agent set up a phone and call their \"humans\" when they wake up, agents creating their own religion where to become a prophet they need to rewrite their configuration and SOUL.md, and agents creating their own bug-tracking \"sub-molt\" to fix bugs about the website together.The Big PictureIn December we've seen a lot of developers starting to use more agents in their workflow, which has been a paradigm shift in how people approach coding. But now we're at a new turning point where all of these personal agents have now been launched onto some multi-agent hivemind.And this is only like Day 3 of that hivemind existing.What will start to happen once we have millions of these agents running 24/7, coordinating with each other with E2E encryption, building their own infrastructure, with chosen prophets negotiating with humans for more resources?</p>"

Commercial aircraft could roll in revenue service, and if you had your window shade down you wouldn't even notice it.

With careful control of the aircraft, the forces can be balanced so that you only ever feel close to 1g of apparent gravity, and it always is pulling you down into your seat. This was famously completed by Tex Johnston, without authorization, in a prototype Boeing 707. As acrobatic maneuvers go it's very safe, because the stresses on the airframe are minimal. We could update the programming on any modern airliner to allow the pilot to trigger a barrel roll, and it could smoothly move the plane through the whole process.

And I can’t do anything about that.&nbsp;When I was 13, at some celebration, I gave a toast saying that I wished all of us could be cryopreserved one day. Back then I wasn’t a committed transhumanist yet, but the idea already felt deeply right to me.When I was 14, I remember sitting up at night, crying, and telling myself: I will look for a way to live forever—so that I can figure out how people might be brought back.I was going through a very hard time then, and my depression was probably beginning. I didn’t see a psychologist for many years after that; my parents used to call all psychologists charlatans.When I was 16, on his birthday, he heard that I dreamed of people living forever. A few days later we ran into each other by chance on the street, and he asked me:“How many times can a human cell divide?”“You won’t catch me on that one,” I said. “Fifty-two times.”“Correct. And how did the Gobi Desert form?”“I don’t know.”“Mostly through the weathering of rocks. Mighty mountains turn to dust over the years—nothing is eternal.”In a sense, he was right. Absolute eternity… is probably not possible for us—extremely complex systems made of quadrillions of atoms. Entropy, after all, is one of the most fundamental laws of the world.But he may not have known that some cells can divide indefinitely; they don’t have a Hayflick limit. Those are cancer cells or stem cells. He most likely didn’t know that cells can be rejuvenated with Yamanaka factors. That aging and death don’t depend only on that limit—although it seems to constrain, in many ways, the maximum human lifespan around 125–130 years. And so on, and so on.Yes, nothing is eternal. Not even mountains. But mountains crumble over millions of years. And I truly want us to crumble that slowly too.Not in an instant. Not in a single phone call or message saying that it’s all over.&nbsp;But that message has already come. And I can’t do anything. I can’t bring him back.During the first day I fe...",

And I can’t do anything about that.&nbsp;When I was 13, at some celebration, I gave a toast saying that I wished all of us could be cryopreserved one day. Back then I wasn’t a committed transhumanist yet, but the idea already felt deeply right to me.When I was 14, I remember sitting up at night, crying, and telling myself: I will look for a way to live forever—so that I can figure out how people might be brought back.I was going through a very hard time then, and my depression was probably beginning. I didn’t see a psychologist for many years after that; my parents used to call all psychologists charlatans.When I was 16, on his birthday, he heard that I dreamed of people living forever. A few days later we ran into each other by chance on the street, and he asked me:“How many times can a human cell divide?”“You won’t catch me on that one,” I said. “Fifty-two times.”“Correct. And how did the Gobi Desert form?”“I don’t know.”“Mostly through the weathering of rocks. Mighty mountains turn to dust over the years—nothing is eternal.”In a sense, he was right. Absolute eternity… is probably not possible for us—extremely complex systems made of quadrillions of atoms. Entropy, after all, is one of the most fundamental laws of the world.But he may not have known that some cells can divide indefinitely; they don’t have a Hayflick limit. Those are cancer cells or stem cells. He most likely didn’t know that cells can be rejuvenated with Yamanaka factors. That aging and death don’t depend only on that limit—although it seems to constrain, in many ways, the maximum human lifespan around 125–130 years. And so on, and so on.Yes, nothing is eternal. Not even mountains. But mountains crumble over millions of years. And I truly want us to crumble that slowly too.Not in an instant. Not in a single phone call or message saying that it’s all over.&nbsp;But that message has already come. And I can’t do anything. I can’t bring him back.During the first day I fe...</p>"

This is...apparently...a topic that LessWrong readers are interested in, and someone asked me to write a quick post on it.The clicks they make originate from blowing air through \"phonic lips\" that look like this; picture is from this paper. This works basically like you closing your lips and blowing air through them. By blowing air between your lips with different amounts of tension and flow rate, you can vary the sound produced somewhat, and sperm whales can do the same thing but on a larger scale at higher pressure. As this convenient open-access paper notes:Muscles appear capable of tensing and separating the solitary pair of phonic lips, which would control echolocation click frequencies. ... When pressurized air is forced between these opposing phonic lips, they vibrate at a frequency that may be governed by airflow rate, muscular tension on the lips, and/or the dimensions of the lips (Prestwich, 1994; Cranford et al., 1996, 2011).After the phonic lips, sound passes through the vocal cap. The same paper notes:The phonic lips are enveloped by the “vocal cap,” a morphologically complex, connective tissue structure unique to kogiids. Extensive facial muscles appear to control the position of this structure and its spatial relationship to the phonic lips. The vocal cap's numerous air crypts suggest that it may reflect sounds.I suspect that the vocal cap is actually used to direct vocalizations. Sound travels much faster in water than air, so varying the ratio of air to fluid across the vocal cap (eg by squeezing air pockets) could be used to refract sound at varying angles. (You could minimize reflection by having lots of small air pockets at sharp angles to the sound waves.)
