      "content": "How can businesses go beyond using AI for incremental efficiency gains to create transformative impact? I write from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where I’ve been speaking with many CEOs about how to use AI for growth. A recurring theme is that running many experimental, bottom-up AI projects — letting a thousand flowers bloom — has failed to lead to significant payoffs. Instead, bigger gains require workflow redesign: taking a broader, perhaps top-down view of the multiple steps in a process and changing how they work together from end to end.\n\nConsider a bank issuing loans. The workflow consists of several discrete stages: \n\nMarketing -> Application -> Preliminary Approval -> Final Review -> Execution\n\nSuppose each step used to be manual. Preliminary Approval used to require an hour-long human review, but a new agentic system can do this automatically in 10 minutes. Swapping human review for AI review — but keeping everything else the same — gives a minor efficiency gain but isn’t transformative.\n\nHere’s what would be transformative: Instead of applicants waiting a week for a human to review their application, they can get a decision in 10 minutes. When that happens, the loan becomes a more compelling product, and that better customer experience allows lenders to attract more applications and ultimately issue more loans.\n\nHowever, making this change requires taking a broader business or product perspective, not just a technology perspective. Further, it changes the workflow of loan processing. Switching to offering a “10-minute loan” product would require changing how it is marketed. Applications would need to be digitized and routed more efficiently, and final review and execution would need to be redesigned to handle a larger volume.\n\nEven though AI is applied only to one step, Preliminary Approval, we end up implementing not just a point solution but a broader workflow redesign that transforms the product offering.\n\nAt AI Aspire (an advisory firm I co-lead), here’s what we see: Bottom-up innovation matters because the people closest to problems often see solutions first. But scaling such ideas to create transformative impact often requires seeing how AI can transform entire workflows end to end, not just individual steps, and this is where top-down strategic direction and innovation can help.\n\nThis year's WEF meeting, as in previous years, has been an energizing event. Among technologists, frequent topics of discussion include Agentic AI (when I coined this term, I was not expecting to see it plastered on billboards and buildings!), Sovereign AI (how nations can control their own access to AI), Talent (the challenging job market for recent graduates, and how to upskill nations), and data-center infrastructure (how to address bottlenecks in energy, talent, GPU chips, and memory). I will address some of these topics in future posts.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, I hope all of us in AI will keep building bridges that connect nations, sharing through open source, and building to benefit all nations and all people.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/Ck52mNGX4a ]",

      "content_html": "<p>How can businesses go beyond using AI for incremental efficiency gains to create transformative impact? I write from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where I’ve been speaking with many CEOs about how to use AI for growth. A recurring theme is that running many experimental, bottom-up AI projects — letting a thousand flowers bloom — has failed to lead to significant payoffs. Instead, bigger gains require workflow redesign: taking a broader, perhaps top-down view of the multiple steps in a process and changing how they work together from end to end.</p>\n<p>Consider a bank issuing loans. The workflow consists of several discrete stages:</p>\n<p>Marketing -&gt; Application -&gt; Preliminary Approval -&gt; Final Review -&gt; Execution</p>\n<p>Suppose each step used to be manual. Preliminary Approval used to require an hour-long human review, but a new agentic system can do this automatically in 10 minutes. Swapping human review for AI review — but keeping everything else the same — gives a minor efficiency gain but isn’t transformative.</p>\n<p>Here’s what would be transformative: Instead of applicants waiting a week for a human to review their application, they can get a decision in 10 minutes. When that happens, the loan becomes a more compelling product, and that better customer experience allows lenders to attract more applications and ultimately issue more loans.</p>\n<p>However, making this change requires taking a broader business or product perspective, not just a technology perspective. Further, it changes the workflow of loan processing. Switching to offering a “10-minute loan” product would require changing how it is marketed. Applications would need to be digitized and routed more efficiently, and final review and execution would need to be redesigned to handle a larger volume.</p>\n<p>Even though AI is applied only to one step, Preliminary Approval, we end up implementing not just a point solution but a broader workflow redesign that transforms the product offering.</p>\n<p>At AI Aspire (an advisory firm I co-lead), here’s what we see: Bottom-up innovation matters because the people closest to problems often see solutions first. But scaling such ideas to create transformative impact often requires seeing how AI can transform entire workflows end to end, not just individual steps, and this is where top-down strategic direction and innovation can help.</p>\n<p>This year's WEF meeting, as in previous years, has been an energizing event. Among technologists, frequent topics of discussion include Agentic AI (when I coined this term, I was not expecting to see it plastered on billboards and buildings!), Sovereign AI (how nations can control their own access to AI), Talent (the challenging job market for recent graduates, and how to upskill nations), and data-center infrastructure (how to address bottlenecks in energy, talent, GPU chips, and memory). I will address some of these topics in future posts.</p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, I hope all of us in AI will keep building bridges that connect nations, sharing through open source, and&nbsp;building to benefit all nations and all people.</p>\n<p>[Original text: https://t.co/Ck52mNGX4a ]</p>"

If you had an early plasma TV you’d need them to make sure your screen wouldn’t burn in. Now on my Apple TV I have the Snoopy screen saver running, in big part because I grew up with Snoopy showing up every day in the comic strips that came with our newspaper. Those days are long gone, haven’t read a newspaper in years, but Snoopy survives.\n\nBeen playing with https://t.co/JdEP14Wq5s and playing with this new real-time world model, which makes videos very differently than, say, Kling does. \n\nIt is a next frame predictor, so you can change the scene and action by typing to it.\n\nBut in playing with it a lot lately I’ve found it’s addictive to use, not because it’s highly accurate, but because it is interactive. Right now it’s a bit limited, will only play for a few minutes, partly, I hear, because generating video this way costs a lot per minute. \n\nThere are a lot of researchers in AI working to make these kinds of real-time world models cheaper, and better, but I remember the days about two years ago when AI video generators first came on the market. Back then everything would look hallucinated with people who had multiple fingers. Today those kinds of models generate cinematic scenes that are even being used in Hollywood to create new scenes and camera moves.\n\nIn two years this new form will be a lot better, and they arrive in a world where autonomous vehicles will be coming out of the woodwork and new kinds of AI-driven glasses/headsets are going to come with a new form of virtual reality driven by these new models. \n\nImagine sitting in a Waymo or a Tesla Robotaxi with your family where you are able to talk to the screen and have a whole bunch of different things happening in reaction.\n\n“Take us skiing in the Swiss Alps.”\n“Show an alien playing in Minecraft.”\n“Show fire breathing dragons destroying a city.”\n\nReally anything your mind can come up with could be on the screen nearly instantly. \n\nIsn’t this a new form of a video game for the family? Yeah!\n\nAnd it could get really crazy inside a new pair of glasses. \n\nDreaming is the role of these today. Sometimes I just need to take a rest from reading X, which overloads my brain with heady posts about new things. I open up Pixverse and type in something and just am entertained by the visuals it shows me, lots of fun on the screen for my kids too. \n\nBut doing that causes me to dream about a new Holodeck coming soon where we can talk and have anything happen.\n\nWhen you try it, what do you dream about? A new video game? A new funny TV show? A new screen saver? Or just a mind break from working that’s different than going back to social media to read the news?\n\nI dream of sending it a little prompt of a story and having it perform the story for me. While riding in an autonomous car with my kids. \n\nIf I had the ear of the engineering team, I wish I could airplay it to my TV so we could sit around the TV asking for new visuals “hey Pixverse put on the screen a bunch of sharks chasing someone on a jet ski.” \n\nI bet such a thing happens soon.

In the video below, we parse all visuals in this CB Insights report into markdown-formatted text and tables.</p>\n<p>This lets Claude Cowork do analysis over any document and give highly accurate responses in seconds.</p>\n<p>My simple wrapper over semtools to batch export files into markdown: https://t.co/Et8IwvxHsY</p>\n<p>Sign up to LlamaCloud: https://t.co/qsGFaIL7uM</p>"
