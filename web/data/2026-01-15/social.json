Claude uses Linux file search commands to find relevant pieces in the codebase:\n\ngrep -r -C 10 -e \"keyword1\" -e \"keyword2\" -e \"keyword3\" /path/to/directory/with/the/app\n\n-r — recursive search\n\n-C 10 — show 10 lines of context before and after each match\n\nwhere keywords 1-3 are generated by the LLM based on the bug description. Once the matches are found, Claude has potentially relevant code snippets and then digs deeper starting from these snippets.\n\nChatGPT apparently uses code embeddings to find relevant code files and then uses a fixed window scanning approach: \"Let me see the first 400 lines of code, now let me see the next 400 lines, ...\". This is why it's very slow and inefficient.\n\nThe fact that ChatGPT uses 400 (a round number and not something learned like 376.4) as a window size makes one think that this scanning approach was human-built rather than learned.\n\nClaude was definitely given a list of Linux commands it can use, such as grep, and then finetuned using RL to use these Linux commands to fix a certain synthetic problem.\n\nAlso, Claude was instructed to generate disposable scripts (and run them in a runtime) that reproduce only a certain chain of dependencies from the entire application by abstracting out irrelevant parts of the full app code.\n\nThis allows recreating, in a tiny script, how the signal of interest passes through the app from input to output without running the full app and see where it gets corrupted. Claude learned to generate such simulated dependency chains and use the result to decide whether the chain needs to be updated and run again or the problem is clear now.\n\nIf the problem was fixed, Claude got a positive reward. Otherwise, the reward was negative. So, the entire process can be trained end to end as a regular LLM finetuning.\n\nOther companies, I'm sure, have already reverse-engineered Claude Code in much better detail than I and understand what needs to be done to catch up with Anthropic.\n\nI expect all major players to have an agentic coding system trained end-to-end by the end of the first quarter of 2026.",

And prepping for the day doesn't work/gives too strange of a readout/didn't prompt to connect to gcal and instead opened claude for chrome to slowly navigate my whole calendar for the next day. Make it more obvious what advanced things I can do that make me say WOW. \n\nThird, speaking of, I wish the wow features were given more weight. I have now demoed Claude Cowork to tons of non-technical people. I know what stands out. Do you know how much of an 'OH MY GOD' I hear when I show that you can queue up tasks? Or that you can stack tasks (like compare these two docs, create a summary, save the summary to my desktop, and then draft an email with that summary in old english)? And even save those tasks to come back to them over and over and over again? Add a widget on the right for the queue. Add a proactive layer. \n\nFourth, multitasking is bigger than people realize. Saw someone from Anthropic say they have 3-8 Claude instances running at once. I really liked the Convergence AI interface for this. Sort of similar (though not as fun as) @emollick experiment with the multi-agent office animation. Stop it with the chat threads.

Morgan event in San Francisco this week. A lot of rich people are in town for this event.</p>\n<p>The networking was extraordinary:</p>\n<p>1. I spent quite a bit of time with legendary investor Esther Dyson @edyson.</p>\n<p>2. I saw a new kind of device that uses magnetic fields to change the cellular structure of your brain and get rid of inflammation.</p>\n<p>You're going to hear a lot more about this device over the next year or two.</p>\n<p>It is helping with many people's pain and mental illnesses.</p>\n<p>It's just a stunning example of how people are able to discover new ways to help human beings with technology.

It prioritizes immediate functionality, leading to hardcoded configurations, which are fragile for future updates. Successful product development requires experienced system design to avoid a \"build-now, regret-later\" scenario, which can then transform AI vibes into structured, sustainable solutions.</p>"

You code a Transformer from scratch in PyTorch. All examples run on Google Colab.\n\nStrengths: Burkov's signature compression—dense without being shallow. Unlike most \"accessible\" books that strip out the math to seem friendly, he keeps it, because the math is the understanding. You walk away knowing why things work, not just that they work.\n\nThe pedagogical arc is unusually well-designed. Rather than dumping Transformers on you in chapter one (the approach most LLM content takes), he builds incrementally: count-based methods → neural language models → RNNs → attention → Transformers → LLMs. Each layer of complexity earns its place because you understand what problem it solves.\n\nIt's genuinely hands-on. You implement three different language model architectures yourself. The Transformer isn't a black box you import—you build it. This kind of \"from scratch\" work cements intuition in ways that reading alone never does.\n\nThe endorsements aren't empty marketing. Tomáš Mikolov (word2vec, FastText) wrote the foreword.

Not for complete beginners to programming or math.\n\nBottom line: If you appreciated his ML book's ethos (concise, rigorous, practical), this delivers the same for the LLM era.

Something is just wrong with this team.</p>\n<p>I hear from people inside and outside that it's a really bad culture in terms of getting people to work on a very innovative product and have big breakthroughs. A lot of the blame goes straight to Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>The truth is, most of the executives at Meta joined the company when they were very young. At that time, 3D computing didn't exist, so there are a lot of \"2D thinkers\" who struggle to get into spatial computing. I've heard that from many people both inside the team and out.</p>\n<p>It's a tough situation. It's just going to take more time for this whole field to mature to a place where consumers see a huge amount of value in wearing a pair of glasses that have a lot of technology in them.</p>"

To do that, I had to connect my Stripe account to X.\n\nI do all my online business using Stripe, just so you understand the situation better.\n\nSo, I connected my Stripe account to X, and THIS DEACTIVATED MY MAIN BUSINESS ACCOUNT.\n\nI couldn't sign in with my username and password: Stripe wouldn't accept the Authenticator app's code.\n\nChapterPal started rejecting subscriptions. The error message was that the user doesn't exist.\n\nI reached out to Stripe support over chat, and the first associate who assisted me said he sees only my X account, that Stripe is nothing but a payment processor, so he doesn't understand what online business I just lost am I talking about, and I must now deal with X.\n\nThe X account on Stripe was empty.\n\nSo, I had to say something like, \"Please understand that my entire online business was just erased. What do I say to my customers?\"\n\nAfter this, he transferred me to a different person while I already started to think about what kind of failure I will look like when I announce to my customers that their subscriptions are gone.\n\nLong story short, I managed to find the account ID for my main account in my browser history, and this other associate managed to locate it in the system. Without knowing this account ID, they saw nothing except the empty X account.\n\nThey said the account was just there, up and running, but I know it wasn't because ChapterPal returned this error message. Then magically, it started to work again.\n\nThe moral of the story: Your online business is with you until the very first glitch in a database you don't control. Luckily, Stripe seems to keep deleted accounts. I wasn't that lucky when Amazon deleted my Kindle Direct Publishing account three years ago, and I lost all my books and book revenue without the possibility to restore the account. Amazon didn't even recognize the account existed; it was wiped out from all their databases with dedication.",

However, this is going to cause the poor people many more problems, because when the rich people leave, the jobs leave.</p>\n<p>If you don't have jobs, you don't have anything in your state. It doesn't matter how good the weather is or how nice the environment is here; if you don't have jobs, the economy starts falling apart. We're chasing away too many jobs in California. We need a new attitude to bring new jobs and new rich people to the state and get them to invest in the people of California.</p>"
