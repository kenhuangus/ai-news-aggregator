      "title": "Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required",
      "content": "Anthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.&quot;Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code,&quot; the company announced via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to Claude Max subscribers — Anthropic&#x27;s power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With Cowork, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding.How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic&#x27;s latest productThe genesis of Cowork lies in Anthropic&#x27;s recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released Claude Code, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.According to Boris Cherny, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks.&quot;Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven,&quot; Cherny wrote on X. &quot;These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model.&quot;Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, Anthropic explained that developers &quot;quickly began using it for almost everything else,&quot; which &quot;prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way.&quot;Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computerUnlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, Cowork requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.&quot;In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder,&quot; the company explained on X. &quot;Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes.&quot;The architecture relies on what is known as an &quot;agentic loop.&quot; When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling &quot;much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.&quot;The system is built on Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Agent SDK, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork &quot;can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.&quot;The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude CoworkPerhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork&#x27;s launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that the team built Cowork in approximately a week and a half.Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: &quot;Holy shit Anthropic built &#x27;Cowork&#x27; in the last... week and a half?!&quot;This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. Simon Smith, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: &quot;Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we&#x27;re in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?&quot;The implication is profound: Anthropic&#x27;s AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork&#x27;s reach beyond the local file systemCowork doesn&#x27;t operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic&#x27;s existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.Additionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic&#x27;s browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.&quot;Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special,&quot; Cherny explained, highlighting &quot;a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it&#x27;s unsure.&quot;Anthropic has also introduced an initial set of &quot;skills&quot; specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude&#x27;s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the Skills for Claude framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their filesThe transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork&#x27;s potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude &quot;can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it&#x27;s instructed to.&quot; Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide &quot;very clear guidance&quot; about sensitive operations.More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.&quot;We&#x27;ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections,&quot; Anthropic wrote, &quot;but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude&#x27;s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry.&quot;The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. &quot;These risks aren&#x27;t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you&#x27;re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation,&quot; the announcement notes.Anthropic&#x27;s desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft CopilotThe launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.However, Anthropic&#x27;s approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.What distinguishes Anthropic&#x27;s approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.Who can access Cowork now, and what&#x27;s coming next for Windows and other platformsFor now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature&#x27;s reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as &quot;early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched.&quot;To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on &quot;Cowork&quot; in the sidebar.The real question facing enterprise AI adoptionFor technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.Anthropic&#x27;s goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.But the speed of Cowork&#x27;s development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company&#x27;s own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone&#x27;s guess.",

An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork&#x27;s potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude &quot;can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it&#x27;s instructed to.&quot; Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide &quot;very clear guidance&quot; about sensitive operations.More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.&quot;We&#x27;ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections,&quot; Anthropic wrote, &quot;but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude&#x27;s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry.&quot;The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. &quot;These risks aren&#x27;t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you&#x27;re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation,&quot; the announcement notes.Anthropic&#x27;s desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft CopilotThe launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.However, Anthropic&#x27;s approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.What distinguishes Anthropic&#x27;s approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.Who can access Cowork now, and what&#x27;s coming next for Windows and other platformsFor now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature&#x27;s reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as &quot;early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched.&quot;To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on &quot;Cowork&quot; in the sidebar.The real question facing enterprise AI adoptionFor technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.Anthropic&#x27;s goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.But the speed of Cowork&#x27;s development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company&#x27;s own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone&#x27;s guess.</p>"

      "content": "\nThe competition in healthcare AI is heating up. Just days after OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, Anthropic has rolled out Claude for Healthcare, accelerating the race to embed generative AI deeper into medical workflows.\n\n\n\nUnlike ChatGPT Health, which operates as a separate, sandboxed space within ChatGPT, Claude for Healthcare is woven directly into Anthropic’s Claude chatbot. According to the company, the new features allow Claude to securely access trusted medical and insurance databases to assist with medical-related queries and routine healthcare tasks.\n\n\n\nFor hospitals and insurers, Claude can verify whether a treatment is covered by insurance or assist with preparing documentation when claims are rejected. For patients, it can simplify complex lab reports and medical histories into understandable language.\n\n\n\nChatGPT Health, by contrast, offers a dedicated environment for health and wellness queries, where users can optionally connect medical records, fitness trackers or nutrition apps. This ensures responses are grounded in personal data rather than generic information.\n\n\n\nBoth offerings are compliant with the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, enabling hospitals, medical providers, insurers and consumers to handle protected health information securely. Anthropic has also integrated scientific databases into Claude and enhanced its capabilities for biological research.\n\n\n\nBeyond OpenAI and Anthropic, startups such as Abridge and Sword Health have attracted multibillion-dollar valuations as investor interest in AI-powered medical tools continues to surge.\n\n\n\nWinning the Race\n\n\n\nThe failures of healthcare products, launched by Google and Microsoft in the pre-generative AI era, serve as cautionary lessons for today’s AI leaders, particularly regarding privacy concerns.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Google launched Google Health, a personal health record (PHR) service that allowed users to upload, store, manage and share their medical information, such as health conditions, medications and allergies. However, it was shut down in 2012 due to poor adoption. Microsoft’s HealthVault, another PHR platform focused on privacy and control from 2007, which allowed users to store and manage health information from various sources, met a similar fate. It was discontinued in 2019 after years of low engagement.\n\n\n\n“Between Anthropic and OpenAI, the more effective tool will be the one that combines strong reasoning capabilities with rigorous safeguards, clinical validation and deep integration into existing healthcare workflows,” Jaspreet Bindra, co-founder of AI&amp;Beyond, told AIM. “Accuracy, explainability and trust matter far more than speed or novelty in this space.”\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s push into healthcare comes as it reveals that health and wellness are already one of ChatGPT’s most common use cases, with over 230 million people worldwide asking health-related questions.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s recent experience highlights the risks of moving too fast. Its AI Overviews feature, launched in May 2024, faced widespread backlash after delivering inaccurate—and in some cases dangerous—health advice. Errors included suggesting users add non-toxic glue to pizza or eat “at least one small rock a day” for minerals. Health experts flagged instances of the medical guidance as “completely incorrect” or “very dangerous”. Google later restricted health-related triggers and refined its systems to avoid satirical or unreliable sources.\n\n\n\n“These errors highlight a broader challenge with deploying generative AI at internet scale without sufficient domain-specific checks,” Bindra said. “In healthcare, especially, companies must slow down, strengthen validation layers, and be transparent about uncertainty and source reliability. The next phase of AI adoption won’t be about who launches first, but who earns trust–particularly when human lives are involved.”\n\n\n\nArsh Goyal, an AI and engineering expert, agrees. “The rush among the Silicon Valley giants to make it big in healthcare is also because whoever earns trust in healthcare essentially earns trust everywhere. The race is more about credibility than speed. With regulatory conversations picking up globally, the time seems to be ripe for them to venture into healthcare.”\n\n\n\nCan Bharat’s Own Health Bot Help?\n\n\n\nIn India, IPO-bound Fractal launched Vaidya AI in 2024—a health assistant now available in beta as the “Vaidya–AI Health Advisor” app on the Google Play Store. Among the early multimodal AI tools in the medical domain, Vaidya.ai has received largely positive feedback from users and the tech community, particularly on LinkedIn and app platforms. Users cite ease of use, security, and the ability to get quick, helpful responses as key strengths.\n\n\n\nFractal has consistently positioned Vaidya.ai as a health companion rather than a diagnostic tool, with a full public release expected soon.\n\n\n\nIn a country where preventive healthcare often takes a back seat, can AI chatbots meaningfully shift behaviour? Dr Manav Suryavanshi, HOD of urology and section in-charge of uro oncology and robotic surgery at Amrita Hospital, believes they can, but within limits.\n\n\n\n“AI tools are outstanding for explaining medical reports in plain language, listing possible causes of symptoms, summarising treatment options, checking drug interactions, preparing you for a doctor’s visit and helping doctors not miss rare possibilities,” he told AIM. Dr Suryavanshi agrees that while AI would become a permanent part of medicine, it must never be used as a diagnostic tool. \n\n\n\n“For patients, the safest model is: AI for understanding. Doctors for decisions,” he cautioned.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgreeing with Dr Suryavanshi, Dr Kingshuk Ganguly, an orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeon in Mumbai, underlined how respecting boundaries while using any AI healthcare tool is critical.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“AI is evolving rapidly and can be a useful adjunct to conventional medical care,” he said. “It can quickly give patients an overview of available treatment modalities. However, AI still struggles to understand human emotions and interactions, which is where a good clinician remains indispensable.” He also pointed to AI’s growing role in imaging technologies such as MRI, X-rays and CT scans.\n\n\n\nAs OpenAI and Anthropic position their tools as trusted allies to healthcare professionals, focused on reducing administrative burden and improving efficiency rather than delivering personalised diagnoses, the obvious question remains: what comes next?

      "content": "Meta&#8217;s US$2 billion acquisition of AI agent startup Manus has become every enterprise CTO&#8217;s cross-border compliance risk lesson. China&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce announced on January 9 that it would assess whether the deal violated export controls, technology transfer rules, and overseas investment regulations, despite Manus relocating from Beijing to Singapore in 2025.\nThe investigation exposes an uncomfortable reality for enterprise AI buyers: your vendor&#8217;s corporate domicile tells you nothing about their regulatory exposure.\n&#8220;The AI agent developed by Manus was definitely something that Chinese regulators could subject to export controls,&#8221; Dai Menghao, Shanghai-based partner at King &amp; Wood Mallesons specialising in export controls and sanctions, told the South China Morning Post. The technology, not the corporate registration, determines jurisdiction.\nWhen relocation doesn&#8217;t equal regulatory freedom\nManus appeared to check every box for regulatory independence. The company relocated its 105-person team from Beijing to Singapore in summer 2025, laid off 80 mainland employees, established operations in Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco, and secured US$75 million in US funding from Benchmark.\nMeta insisted in December that &#8220;there will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China.&#8221;\nYet Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong made clear that corporate structure alone won&#8217;t determine compliance. &#8220;The Chinese government consistently supports enterprises in conducting mutually beneficial transnational operations and international technological cooperation in accordance with laws and regulations,&#8221; he said at a January 9 press briefing.\n&#8220;But it should be noted that the external investment, technology exports, data exports and cross-border acquisitions by companies must comply with Chinese laws and regulations and go through due process.&#8221;\nThe investigation will examine when, how, and which technologies Manus transferred abroad from its China-based entities, according to Cui Fan, professor at the University of International Business and Economics and chief expert at the China Society for World Trade Organisation Studies.\nIf regulators determine that Manus should have obtained export licenses before transferring technology or talent, the company&#8217;s founders could face criminal charges under Chinese law.\nThe regulatory framework that enterprise buyers must understand\nChina updated its technology export control rules in 2020, expanding coverage to include certain algorithms – changes widely interpreted as giving Beijing stronger legal grounds to intervene in deals involving strategic technology.\nThe updates gained prominence after the US pressured ByteDance to divest TikTok&#8217;s US operations, prompting China to assert authority over outbound tech transfers. The framework covers three important areas that enterprise AI buyers should understand when evaluating vendor risk:\nExport controls: Advanced AI agents, models, and related intellectual property qualify as strategic assets subject to licensing requirements. Beijing maintains jurisdiction over technology developed in China, regardless of where companies later incorporate.\nData security rules: Cross-border data transfers require regulatory approval, particularly for datasets used to train or fine-tune AI models. The location where training occurred matters more than where inference happens.\nOverseas investment regulations: When Chinese nationals transfer technology assets abroad, even through legitimate corporate restructuring, authorities assess whether the transfer requires government clearance.\nWang Yiming, partner at Beijing Xinzheng law firm, estimates the Manus review could take up to six months – matching the timeline for similar technology transfer assessments. &#8220;This could become a high-profile test case for China&#8217;s equivalent of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,&#8221; Winston Ma, adjunct professor at New York University School of Law who focuses on AI and the digital economy, told SCMP.\nWhat this means for AI vendor due diligence\nThe Manus case exposes gaps in how enterprise buyers assess AI vendor regulatory risk. Standard procurement processes focus on data residency, service level agreements, and contractual liability.\nFew evaluate whether their vendor&#8217;s technology development history creates ongoing compliance exposure in multiple jurisdictions.\nEnterprise buyers should now ask AI service providers:\nTechnology origin questions:\n\nWhere was the core AI model or agent developed?\nWhich jurisdictions&#8217; export control regimes might claim authority?\nWere any team members involved in the development of Chinese nationals?\n\nTransfer compliance:\n\nIf the company relocated, what regulatory approvals were obtained?\nCan the vendor demonstrate export license compliance for technology transfers?\nWhat contingency exists if regulators challenge past transfers?\n\nOperational continuity:\n\nHow would a regulatory investigation impact service delivery?\nWhat customer notification obligations exist during review periods?\nDoes the vendor maintain insurance or reserves for regulatory risk?\n\n&#8220;The most likely outcome I see is a lengthier approval process and potential conditions around how Manus technology developed in China can be used, rather than an outright block,&#8221; Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. &#8220;But the threat of stricter action gives Beijing bargaining power in a high-profile, US-led acquisition.&#8221;\nThe precedent risk for enterprise AI strategy\nThe investigation matters beyond Meta&#8217;s specific deal. If Beijing determines it can effectively assert jurisdiction over Chinese-origin AI technology regardless of corporate restructuring, it establishes precedent for ongoing regulatory reach into enterprise AI supply chains.\nEnterprise buyers using AI agents for market research, coding assistance, or data analysis – precisely what Manus offered before Meta&#8217;s acquisition – now face questions about provider stability during geopolitical disputes. The company reached US$100 million in annual recurring revenue in eight months of launch, demonstrating both rapid enterprise adoption and how quickly mission-important dependencies can form.\nWinston Ma noted that smooth approval could &#8220;create a new path for young AI startups in China&#8221; – physical relocation paired with foreign acquisitions to bypass technology transfer restrictions.\nConversely, regulatory intervention signals that Beijing will pursue Chinese-origin AI companies even after they relocate, potentially closing what appeared to be an escape route for startups navigating US-China tensions.\nFor enterprise AI buyers, the lesson is about recognising that AI vendor compliance risk extends beyond contractual terms into murky jurisdictional questions about where and by whom technology was originally developed. That&#8217;s a due diligence requirement most procurement teams haven&#8217;t yet built the capacity to assess.\nSee also: Manus AI agent: breakthrough in China&#8217;s agentic AI\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

The company reached US$100 million in annual recurring revenue in eight months of launch, demonstrating both rapid enterprise adoption and how quickly mission-important dependencies can form.</p>\n<p>Winston Ma noted that smooth approval could &#8220;create a new path for young AI startups in China&#8221; – physical relocation paired with foreign acquisitions to bypass technology transfer restrictions.</p>\n<p>Conversely, regulatory intervention signals that Beijing will pursue Chinese-origin AI companies even after they relocate, potentially closing what appeared to be an escape route for startups navigating US-China tensions.</p>\n<p>For enterprise AI buyers, the lesson is about recognising that AI vendor compliance risk extends beyond contractual terms into murky jurisdictional questions about where and by whom technology was originally developed.

      "title": "How Shopify is bringing agentic AI to enterprise commerce",
      "content": "Shopify is enhancing core enterprise commerce workflows with agentic AI, automating operations while expanding sales channels.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of generative AI in commerce has largely centred on customer support chatbots and basic content generation. Shopify’s Winter ‘26 Edition, titled Renaissance, pushes this technology toward agentic commerce where AI systems actively manage workflows, configure infrastructure, and distribute products into third-party ecosystems.\n\n\n\nModernising commerce with the agentic AI storefront\n\n\n\nThe most distinct architectural adjustment is the introduction of ‘Agentic Storefronts’. Traditionally, merchants drive traffic to a proprietary domain to secure a conversion. Shopify’s new model allows products to surface directly within AI-driven conversations on platforms such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot.\n\n\n\nFor CDOs, this fragmentation of the customer journey requires a change in channel strategy. Rather than complex integrations for each external platform, products configured in the admin become discoverable by these agents immediately. The transaction occurs within the conversation, with attribution data flowing back to the central admin. This capability addresses the risk of brand invisibility as search behaviour migrates toward LLMs.\n\n\n\n“AI is now essential to modern commerce,” says Deann Evans, Managing Director, EMEA at Shopify.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEvans points to internal data suggesting 93 percent of UK merchants are investing in AI tools to aid discovery, aligning with the 66 percent of consumers who expect to use AI for at least one part of their holiday shopping.\n\n\n\nOperational intelligence and ‘Sidekick’ updates\n\n\n\nWhile distributed commerce addresses revenue generation, the updates to ‘Sidekick’ (Shopify’s AI assistant) target operational expenditures and efficiency. The tool has evolved from a reactive AI chatbot into a proactive agentic system capable of executing complex administrative tasks for commerce.\n\n\n\nSidekick Pulse now surfaces personalised tasks based on real-time data, such as suggesting product bundles when specific cart behaviours are detected or flagging compliance gaps like missing return policies.\n\n\n\nFor technical teams, the reduction in low-level ticket volume is a primary benefit. Sidekick can now generate admin applications from natural language prompts, allowing non-technical staff to build custom tools without developer intervention. Furthermore, it creates ‘Working Flow’ automations from descriptions to bypass the need for deep knowledge of Shopify’s specific logic syntax.\n\n\n\nTo support standardisation across large teams, prompts can now be saved and shared as &#8220;skills,&#8221; ensuring that verified and safe prompt structures are reused rather than ad-hoc queries.\n\n\n\nA persistent difficulty for enterprise retail is testing changes without disrupting live revenue streams. Shopify has introduced ‘SimGym’ (currently in research preview) and ‘Rollouts’ to address this.\n\n\n\nSimGym utilises AI shopper agents with human-like profiles to simulate traffic and purchasing behaviour. This allows merchants to model how storefront changes affect conversion rates using synthetic data derived from billions of annual purchases, rather than waiting for live A/B test results.\n\n\n\nComplementing this, Rollouts provides native experimentation capabilities within the admin, allowing for controlled scheduled changes and data-informed decision-making regarding buyer behaviour. For the C-suite, this reduces the risk profile of platform updates and marketing experiments.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure and developer velocity\n\n\n\nBeyond agentic AI, the update addresses physical commerce infrastructure and developer tooling. The new ‘POS Hub’ offers a wired connectivity solution for retail hardware, designed to improve resilience in high-volume brick-and-mortar environments. It acts as a dedicated operational unit, integrating card readers and scanners via a stable connection, which is vital for maintaining throughput during peak trading periods.\n\n\n\nOn the software side, the AI-native developer platform aims to accelerate build times. AI agents can now scaffold apps, execute GraphQL operations, and generate validated code. This is supported by the Shopify Catalog, which enables agents to search across hundreds of millions of products to build richer applications.\n\n\n\nVanessa Lee, VP of Leading Product at Shopify, commented: “We chose the Renaissance theme for this Edition because it symbolises progress, momentum, courage, and new beginnings &#8230; Many of these features weren’t possible a year ago and they redefine how we achieve our mission of making commerce better for everyone.”\n\n\n\nFor enterprise leaders, the barrier to creating custom internal tools has lowered. The storefront is also no longer a static destination; it is a distributed set of data points accessible by third-party AI agents. Preparing product data for the agentic AI future of commerce is now a requisite for maintaining competitive visibility.\n\n\n\nSee also: Retailers like Kroger and Lowe’s test AI agents without handing control to Google\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

This capability addresses the risk of brand invisibility as search behaviour migrates toward LLMs.</p>\n<p>“AI is now essential to modern commerce,” says Deann Evans, Managing Director, EMEA at Shopify.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Evans points to internal data suggesting 93 percent of UK merchants are investing in AI tools to aid discovery, aligning with the 66 percent of consumers who expect to use AI for at least one part of their holiday shopping.</p>\n<p>Operational intelligence and ‘Sidekick’ updates</p>\n<p>While distributed commerce addresses revenue generation, the updates to ‘Sidekick’ (Shopify’s AI assistant) target operational expenditures and efficiency. The tool has evolved from a reactive AI chatbot into a proactive agentic system capable of executing complex administrative tasks for commerce.</p>\n<p>Sidekick Pulse now surfaces personalised tasks based on real-time data, such as suggesting product bundles when specific cart behaviours are detected or flagging compliance gaps like missing return policies.</p>\n<p>For technical teams, the reduction in low-level ticket volume is a primary benefit. Sidekick can now generate admin applications from natural language prompts, allowing non-technical staff to build custom tools without developer intervention. Furthermore, it creates ‘Working Flow’ automations from descriptions to bypass the need for deep knowledge of Shopify’s specific logic syntax.</p>\n<p>To support standardisation across large teams, prompts can now be saved and shared as &#8220;skills,&#8221; ensuring that verified and safe prompt structures are reused rather than ad-hoc queries.</p>\n<p>A persistent difficulty for enterprise retail is testing changes without disrupting live revenue streams. Shopify has introduced ‘SimGym’ (currently in research preview) and ‘Rollouts’ to address this.</p>\n<p>SimGym utilises AI shopper agents with human-like profiles to simulate traffic and purchasing behaviour. This allows merchants to model how storefront changes affect conversion rates using synthetic data derived from billions of annual purchases, rather than waiting for live A/B test results.</p>\n<p>Complementing this, Rollouts provides native experimentation capabilities within the admin, allowing for controlled scheduled changes and data-informed decision-making regarding buyer behaviour. For the C-suite, this reduces the risk profile of platform updates and marketing experiments.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure and developer velocity</p>\n<p>Beyond agentic AI, the update addresses physical commerce infrastructure and developer tooling. The new ‘POS Hub’ offers a wired connectivity solution for retail hardware, designed to improve resilience in high-volume brick-and-mortar environments. It acts as a dedicated operational unit, integrating card readers and scanners via a stable connection, which is vital for maintaining throughput during peak trading periods.</p>\n<p>On the software side, the AI-native developer platform aims to accelerate build times. AI agents can now scaffold apps, execute GraphQL operations, and generate validated code. This is supported by the Shopify Catalog, which enables agents to search across hundreds of millions of products to build richer applications.</p>\n<p>Vanessa Lee, VP of Leading Product at Shopify, commented: “We chose the Renaissance theme for this Edition because it symbolises progress, momentum, courage, and new beginnings &#8230; Many of these features weren’t possible a year ago and they redefine how we achieve our mission of making commerce better for everyone.”</p>\n<p>For enterprise leaders, the barrier to creating custom internal tools has lowered. The storefront is also no longer a static destination; it is a distributed set of data points accessible by third-party AI agents. Preparing product data for the agentic AI future of commerce is now a requisite for maintaining competitive visibility.</p>\n<p>See also: Retailers like Kroger and Lowe’s test AI agents without handing control to Google</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

While agent-based shopping is gaining attention, it is not yet the main way people buy everyday goods.\n\n\n\n“I don’t think [AI agents] are going to totally change the industry,” Vasconi said. “People still call our stores on the phone to order pizza in this day and age.”\n\n\n\nAnalysts see Google’s tools less as a finished answer and more as a way to lower the barrier for retailers that do not want to start from scratch. “The real challenge here is application of the technologies,” said Ed Anderson, a tech analyst at Gartner. “These announcements take a step forward so that retailers don’t have to start from ground zero.”\n\n\n\nFor now, retailers are testing, mixing vendors, and holding back from firm commitments.

      "title": "How This Agentic Memory Research Unifies Long Term and Short Term Memory for LLM Agents",
      "content": "How do you design an LLM agent that decides for itself what to store in long term memory, what to keep in short term context and what to discard, without hand tuned heuristics or extra controllers? Can a single policy learn to manage both memory types through the same action space as text generation?\n\n\n\nResearchers from Alibaba Group and Wuhan University introduce Agentic Memory, or AgeMem, a framework that lets large language model agents learn how to manage both long term and short term memory as part of a single policy. Instead of relying on hand written rules or external controllers, the agent decides when to store, retrieve, summarize and forget, using memory tools that are integrated into the action space of the model.\n\n\n\nWhy current LLM agents struggle with memory\n\n\n\nMost agent frameworks treat memory as two loosely coupled systems.\n\n\n\nLong term memory stores user profiles, task information and previous interactions across sessions. Short term memory is the current context window, which holds the active dialogue and retrieved documents.\n\n\n\nExisting systems design these two parts in isolation. Long term memory is handled through external stores such as vector databases with simple add and retrieve triggers. Short term memory is managed with retrieval augmented generation, sliding windows or summarization schedules.\n\n\n\nThis separation creates several issues.\n\n\n\n\nLong term and short term memory are optimized independently. Their interaction is not trained end to end.\n\n\n\nHeuristics decide when to write to memory and when to summarize. These rules are brittle and miss rare but important events.\n\n\n\nAdditional controllers or expert models increase cost and system complexity.\n\n\n\n\nAgeMem removes the external controller and folds memory operations into the agent policy itself.\n\n\n\nMemory as tools in the agent action space\n\n\n\nIn AgeMem, memory operations are exposed as tools. At each step, the model can emit either normal text tokens or a tool call. The framework defines 6 tools.\n\n\n\nFor long term memory:\n\n\n\n\nADD stores a new memory item with content and metadata.\n\n\n\nUPDATE modifies an existing memory entry.\n\n\n\nDELETE removes obsolete or low value items.\n\n\n\n\nFor short term memory:\n\n\n\n\nRETRIEVE performs semantic search over long term memory and injects the retrieved items into the current context.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY compresses spans of the dialogue into shorter summaries.\n\n\n\nFILTER removes context segments that are not useful for future reasoning.\n\n\n\n\nThe interaction protocol has a structured format. Each step starts with a &lt;think&gt; block where the model reasons privately. Then the model either emits a &lt;tool_call&gt; block with a JSON list of tool invocations, or an &lt;answer&gt; block with the user facing response. Memory actions are therefore first class decisions, not side effects.\n\n\n\nThree stage reinforcement learning for unified memory\n\n\n\nAgeMem is trained with reinforcement learning in a way that couples long term and short term memory behavior.\n\n\n\nThe state at time t includes the current conversational context, the long term memory store and the task specification. The policy chooses either a token or a tool call as the action. The training trajectory for each sample is divided into 3 stages:\n\n\n\n\nStage 1, long term memory construction: The agent interacts in a casual setting and observes information that will later become relevant. It uses ADD, UPDATE and DELETE to build and maintain long term memory. The short term context grows naturally during this stage.\n\n\n\nStage 2, short term memory control under distractors: The short term context is reset. Long term memory persists. The agent now receives distractor content that is related but not necessary. It must manage short term memory using SUMMARY and FILTER to keep useful content and remove noise.\n\n\n\nStage 3, integrated reasoning: The final query arrives. The agent retrieves from long term memory using RETRIEVE, controls the short term context, and produces the answer.\n\n\n\n\nThe crucial detail is that long term memory persists across all stages while short term memory is cleared between Stage 1 and Stage 2. This design forces the model to rely on retrieval rather than on residual context and exposes realistic long horizon dependencies.\n\n\n\nReward design and step wise GRPO\n\n\n\nAgeMem uses a step wise variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For each task, the system samples multiple trajectories that form a group. A terminal reward is computed for each trajectory, then normalized within the group to obtain an advantage signal. This advantage is broadcast to all steps in the trajectory so that intermediate tool choices are trained using the final outcome.\n\n\n\nThe total reward has three main components:\n\n\n\n\nA task reward that scores answer quality between 0 and 1 using an LLM judge.\n\n\n\nA context reward that measures the quality of short term memory operations, including compression, early summarization and preservation of query relevant content.\n\n\n\nA memory reward that measures long term memory quality, including the fraction of high quality stored items, the usefulness of maintenance operations and the relevance of retrieved items to the query.\n\n\n\n\nUniform weights are used for these three components so that each contributes equally to the learning signal. A penalty term is added when the agent exceeds the maximum allowed dialogue length or when the context overflows the limit.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01885\n\n\nExperimental setup and main results\n\n\n\nThe research team fine-tune AgeMem on the HotpotQA training split and evaluate on 5 benchmarks:\n\n\n\n\nALFWorld for text based embodied tasks.\n\n\n\nSciWorld for science themed environments.\n\n\n\nBabyAI for instruction following.\n\n\n\nPDDL tasks for planning.\n\n\n\nHotpotQA for multi hop question answering.\n\n\n\n\nMetrics include success rate for ALFWorld, SciWorld and BabyAI, progress rate for PDDL tasks, and an LLM judge score for HotpotQA. They also define a Memory Quality metric using an LLM evaluator that compares stored memories to the supporting facts of HotpotQA.\n\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01885\n\n\nBaselines include LangMem, A Mem, Mem0, Mem0g and a no memory agent. Backbones are Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen3-4B-Instruct.\n\n\n\nOn Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, AgeMem reaches an average score of 41.96 across the 5 benchmarks, while the best baseline, Mem0, reaches 37.14. On Qwen3-4B-Instruct, AgeMem reaches 54.31, compared to 45.74 for the best baseline, A Mem.\n\n\n\nMemory quality also improves. On HotpotQA, AgeMem reaches 0.533 with Qwen2.5-7B and 0.605 with Qwen3-4B, which is higher than all baselines.\n\n\n\nShort term memory tools reduce prompt length while preserving performance. On HotpotQA, configurations with STM tools use about 3 to 5 percent fewer tokens per prompt than variants that replace STM tools with a retrieval pipeline.\n\n\n\nAblation studies confirm that each component matters. Adding only long term memory tools on top of a no memory baseline already yields clear gains. Adding reinforcement learning on these tools improves scores further. The full system with both long term and short term tools plus RL gives up to 21.7 percentage points improvement over the no memory baseline on SciWorld.\n\n\n\nImplications for LLM agent design\n\n\n\nAgeMem suggests a design pattern for future agentic systems. Memory should be handled as part of the learned policy, not as two external subsystems. By turning storage, retrieval, summarization and filtering into explicit tools and training them jointly with language generation, the agent learns when to remember, when to forget and how to manage context efficiently across long horizons.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nAgeMem turns memory operations into explicit tools, so the same policy that generates text also decides when to ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, RETRIEVE, SUMMARY and FILTER memory.\n\n\n\nLong term and short term memory are trained jointly through a three stage RL setup where long term memory persists across stages and short term context is reset to enforce retrieval based reasoning.\n\n\n\nThe reward function combines task accuracy, context management quality and long term memory quality with uniform weights, plus penalties for context overflow and excessive dialogue length.\n\n\n\nAcross ALFWorld, SciWorld, BabyAI, PDDL tasks and HotpotQA, AgeMem on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-4B consistently outperforms memory baselines such as LangMem, A Mem and Mem0 on average scores and memory quality metrics.\n\n\n\nShort term memory tools reduce prompt length by about 3 to 5 percent compared to RAG style baselines while keeping or improving performance, showing that learned summarization and filtering can replace handcrafted context handling rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the FULL PAPER here. Also, feel free to follow us on Twitter and don’t forget to join our 100k+ ML SubReddit and Subscribe to our Newsletter.

      "content_html": "<p>How do you design an LLM agent that decides for itself what to store in long term memory, what to keep in short term context and what to discard, without hand tuned heuristics or extra controllers? Can a single policy learn to manage both memory types through the same action space as text generation?</p>\n<p>Researchers from Alibaba Group and Wuhan University introduce Agentic Memory, or AgeMem, a framework that lets large language model agents learn how to manage both long term and short term memory as part of a single policy. Instead of relying on hand written rules or external controllers, the agent decides when to store, retrieve, summarize and forget, using memory tools that are integrated into the action space of the model.</p>\n<p>Why current LLM agents struggle with memory</p>\n<p>Most agent frameworks treat memory as two loosely coupled systems.</p>\n<p>Long term memory stores user profiles, task information and previous interactions across sessions. Short term memory is the current context window, which holds the active dialogue and retrieved documents.</p>\n<p>Existing systems design these two parts in isolation. Long term memory is handled through external stores such as vector databases with simple add and retrieve triggers. Short term memory is managed with retrieval augmented generation, sliding windows or summarization schedules.</p>\n<p>This separation creates several issues.</p>\n<p>Long term and short term memory are optimized independently. Their interaction is not trained end to end.</p>\n<p>Heuristics decide when to write to memory and when to summarize. These rules are brittle and miss rare but important events.</p>\n<p>Additional controllers or expert models increase cost and system complexity.</p>\n<p>AgeMem removes the external controller and folds memory operations into the agent policy itself.</p>\n<p>Memory as tools in the agent action space</p>\n<p>In AgeMem, memory operations are exposed as tools. At each step, the model can emit either normal text tokens or a tool call. The framework defines 6 tools.</p>\n<p>For long term memory:</p>\n<p>ADD stores a new memory item with content and metadata.</p>\n<p>UPDATE modifies an existing memory entry.</p>\n<p>DELETE removes obsolete or low value items.</p>\n<p>For short term memory:</p>\n<p>RETRIEVE performs semantic search over long term memory and injects the retrieved items into the current context.</p>\n<p>SUMMARY compresses spans of the dialogue into shorter summaries.</p>\n<p>FILTER removes context segments that are not useful for future reasoning.</p>\n<p>The interaction protocol has a structured format. Each step starts with a &lt;think&gt; block where the model reasons privately. Then the model either emits a &lt;tool_call&gt; block with a JSON list of tool invocations, or an &lt;answer&gt; block with the user facing response.

      "content": "\nApple has entered into a multi-year collaboration with Google under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be built on Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology, the companies said on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe new foundation models will power upcoming Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalised version of Siri expected to roll out later this year. According to the announcement, Apple selected Google’s technology after evaluating multiple options.\n\n\n\n“After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Google said in a statement. “These models will help unlock new experiences for Apple users.”\n\n\n\nApple said Apple Intelligence will continue to operate on Apple devices and through its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, a system designed to handle more complex AI tasks while limiting data exposure. “Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading privacy standards,” the company said.\n\n\n\nOn January 7, Google became the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple for the first time since 2019.\n\n\n\nThe partnership reflects a change in Apple’s approach to developing the core models behind its AI features. Until now, Apple Intelligence has been powered primarily by Apple’s in-house foundation models, introduced in 2024 and optimised for on-device use on Apple silicon. Those models focused on tasks such as text rewriting, summarisation, image generation, and basic Siri improvements, with larger requests routed to Private Cloud Compute.\n\n\n\nApple has positioned Apple Intelligence as a hybrid system, combining on-device processing with cloud-based models for more demanding tasks, while emphasising that user data is not stored or used to train external models.\n\n\n\nThe deal also strengthens Google’s position as a provider of foundation models and cloud infrastructure to major technology companies. Gemini is Google’s flagship family of AI models and is already used across its own products, including Search, Workspace, and Android.\n\n\n\nApple did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement or specify which versions of Gemini would be used. Meanwhile, Google recently launched its latest model, Gemini 3.&nbsp;\nThe post Apple, Google Enter Multi-Year Deal to Power Apple Intelligence Models appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.",

According to the announcement, Apple selected Google’s technology after evaluating multiple options.</p>\n<p>“After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Google said in a statement. “These models will help unlock new experiences for Apple users.”</p>\n<p>Apple said Apple Intelligence will continue to operate on Apple devices and through its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, a system designed to handle more complex AI tasks while limiting data exposure. “Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading privacy standards,” the company said.</p>\n<p>On January 7, Google became the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple for the first time since 2019.</p>\n<p>The partnership reflects a change in Apple’s approach to developing the core models behind its AI features. Until now, Apple Intelligence has been powered primarily by Apple’s in-house foundation models, introduced in 2024 and optimised for on-device use on Apple silicon. Those models focused on tasks such as text rewriting, summarisation, image generation, and basic Siri improvements, with larger requests routed to Private Cloud Compute.</p>\n<p>Apple has positioned Apple Intelligence as a hybrid system, combining on-device processing with cloud-based models for more demanding tasks, while emphasising that user data is not stored or used to train external models.</p>\n<p>The deal also strengthens Google’s position as a provider of foundation models and cloud infrastructure to major technology companies. Gemini is Google’s flagship family of AI models and is already used across its own products, including Search, Workspace, and Android.</p>\n<p>Apple did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement or specify which versions of Gemini would be used. Meanwhile, Google recently launched its latest model, Gemini 3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post Apple, Google Enter Multi-Year Deal to Power Apple Intelligence Models appeared first on Analytics India Magazine.</p>"
