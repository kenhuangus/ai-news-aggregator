      "content": "Here's more analysis on the Apple and Google deal to make a new kind of Siri, after I had a cup of coffee.\n\nThis is what OpenAI is doing: they're making a variety of new products and going after Apple. Apple didn't want to give OpenAI any more data to help a potential new competitor.\n\nThe real problem for this OpenAI effort is that we're about to move to glasses. People don't believe me that we're about to move to glasses, but you should, because I just got back from CES and there was a ton of glasses there.\n\nFor OpenAI to really get somewhere, they need to add a camera to an earphone. While I don't see that in this latest report, I won't be shocked to see a camera show up somewhere eventually. \n\nIt is cameras that add understanding of the real world, which can lead to many new features that Apple's current AirPods Pro can't match.\n\nI believe Apple is developing such a product to go with their glasses, which makes a lot of sense. Also, Google's AI models are better at multimodality; this means they can use cameras in a much better way than even OpenAI's models can.\n\nThis is why in Silicon Valley robotics companies, a lot of them use Google Gemini: because robots need multimodality.\n\nApple's glasses, which are expected in 2027, have some significant advantages over the others.\n\nFirst, they have eye sensors in them, so it knows where the user is looking. It also can tell what the user is touching, holding, or gesturing towards.\n\nThis new capability will give Siri a significant parlor trick: it will let Siri answer questions that no other search engine has been able to answer before.\n\nBut the real reason I'm still bullish on Apple's glasses isn't technology—it's content.\n\nApple has NBA rights and Formula One (among others) and a really great studio system, which has produced one of the biggest hits of the last six months. Pluribus.\n\nApple also, because of its privacy stance, has a significant lead in consumer trust. Because of its retail stores, it also has a significant lead in the ability to:\n1. Show people glasses\n2. Get them fit properly\n3. Get people trained\n\nOn Saturday, I went to the main Apple store in Cupertino and watched one of the classes that they teach every few hours in an Apple store.\n\nThe store was packed with people watching the class on a huge screen in the middle of the store. Apple has dramatically changed retail because of its stores, which gives it the most trusted brand in the business and gives it distribution to most of the world's richest people.\n\nWhile OpenAI has almost a billion users, it is unclear whether those users will switch ecosystems from Apple to OpenAI.\n\nEven if OpenAI's AI and devices can do a few more things, I'm not so sure anybody's going to care when Apple has very capable headphones that match up with their iPhones and has the world's richest people addicted to the Apple ecosystem (me included).\n\nHere is one of the secret Chinese suites at CES, which makes a series of glasses to sell to other brands. This gives you a sense of how fast the glasses world is moving.\n\nAI needs to not just tell you what it's seeing, but it needs to show you things to really make the solution complete.\n\nAlso, Apple usually picks a much better design than anyone else. Because it's such a luxury brand, it can charge more than anybody else and be more profitable. \n\nI don't see anyone else being able to put together the whole solution the way Apple can. Therefore, I am still very bullish on Apple making a dramatic announcement about glasses sometime in the next 24 months.\n\nAt CES, though, it's clear that many manufacturers will try. @XREAL_Global just got $100 million of funding to continue its glasses development, and officials of the company told me it will release its Android XR based glasses later this year. \n\nShort version: AI is coming to wearables in a big way, and Apple will do what it always does: come in late to the market and redefine it when it enters. It still has all the pieces to put together the puzzle, even though it doesn't have its own LLM so had to do a deal with Google for that. \n\nYeah, others will be earlier to the market, and will win some buyers because of that, but buyers like me know that and will be happy to put down our other ones to buy Apple because of its advantages. \n\nWith one big caveat: Apple has to deliver an amazing pair of glasses, and maybe a headphone with a camera, to keep the competition from taking its lunch.\n\nAlso, behind the scenes there is a big patent battle brewing. Apple has quite a few, but I talked with Ann Greenberg at CES, who started Gracenote. She says she has several patents that will enable a large company to force others to license their technology and that she's already in final stages of selling those patents to a big company. All the big companies have patent portfolios they can use against each other, and particularly smaller, newer, competitors. Microsoft alone has dozens of patents it bought to start off its Hololens efforts, which it gave up on, but Microsoft still has almost 1,000 lawyers who would love to go after other companies for licensing deals. Plus, Google-funded Magic Leap has about 1,000 patents, so it'll be interesting to see if anyone buys the remnants of that company. \n\nThe question is: can anyone disrupt Apple? Especially OpenAI?",

Apple has dramatically changed retail because of its stores, which gives it the most trusted brand in the business and gives it distribution to most of the world's richest people.</p>\n<p>While OpenAI has almost a billion users, it is unclear whether those users will switch ecosystems from Apple to OpenAI.</p>\n<p>Even if OpenAI's AI and devices can do a few more things, I'm not so sure anybody's going to care when Apple has very capable headphones that match up with their iPhones and has the world's richest people addicted to the Apple ecosystem (me included).</p>\n<p>Here is one of the secret Chinese suites at CES, which makes a series of glasses to sell to other brands. This gives you a sense of how fast the glasses world is moving.</p>\n<p>AI needs to not just tell you what it's seeing, but it needs to show you things to really make the solution complete.</p>\n<p>Also, Apple usually picks a much better design than anyone else. Because it's such a luxury brand, it can charge more than anybody else and be more profitable.</p>\n<p>I don't see anyone else being able to put together the whole solution the way Apple can. Therefore, I am still very bullish on Apple making a dramatic announcement about glasses sometime in the next 24 months.</p>\n<p>At CES, though, it's clear that many manufacturers will try. @XREAL_Global just got $100 million of funding to continue its glasses development, and officials of the company told me it will release its Android XR based glasses later this year.</p>\n<p>Short version: AI is coming to wearables in a big way, and Apple will do what it always does: come in late to the market and redefine it when it enters. It still has all the pieces to put together the puzzle, even though it doesn't have its own LLM so had to do a deal with Google for that.</p>\n<p>Yeah, others will be earlier to the market, and will win some buyers because of that, but buyers like me know that and will be happy to put down our other ones to buy Apple because of its advantages.</p>\n<p>With one big caveat: Apple has to deliver an amazing pair of glasses, and maybe a headphone with a camera, to keep the competition from taking its lunch.</p>\n<p>Also, behind the scenes there is a big patent battle brewing. Apple has quite a few, but I talked with Ann Greenberg at CES, who started Gracenote. She says she has several patents that will enable a large company to force others to license their technology and that she's already in final stages of selling those patents to a big company. All the big companies have patent portfolios they can use against each other, and particularly smaller, newer, competitors. Microsoft alone has dozens of patents it bought to start off its Hololens efforts, which it gave up on, but Microsoft still has almost 1,000 lawyers who would love to go after other companies for licensing deals. Plus, Google-funded Magic Leap has about 1,000 patents, so it'll be interesting to see if anyone buys the remnants of that company.</p>\n<p>The question is: can anyone disrupt Apple? Especially OpenAI?</p>"

      "content": "Excited to announce the Relative Adoption Metric a new way of studying model downloads that contextualizes it across time and model sizes.\n\nWhile building The ATOM Project and other tools to measure the open ecosystem at @interconnectsai, we are often frustrated with using downloads as a primary metric. We, and the community, know that small models are downloaded much more, so it makes some adoption metrics favor organizations releasing small models. Over the 1,100+ leading LLMs we track carefully, more than 1.4 billion of ~2 billion total downloads come from models in the 1-9B range.\n\nThis small model dominance happens to be partially caused by far more models *being released* at that size. Among the top 10 downloaded models at each size category, the median models from 1-9B parameters are only downloaded about 4X the count of models of 100B+ parameters. Still, this difference combined with the potential of small models to be outliers in downloads—by being loaded in the continuous integration (CI) tests of ML developers checking their code and other at-scale automated systems—makes small models dominate plots.\n\nWe created the **Relative Adoption Metric**, reported as a RAM Score, to be able to tell within 30-90 days if a new model is on track to be ecosystem defining. We can already see that some models, such as GPT-OSS, are truly exceptional. In releasing only 2 models, OpenAI is well on the map as a top 5-10 open model lab in adoption metrics—this is hard to see when comparing organizations versus each other, when OpenAI's competitors may have many models.\n\nWe're also excited to see that some recent larger models from newer AI labs on the scene, such as MiniMax or Moonshot AI, are outperforming the metric, indicating competition in the large MoE space dominated by DeepSeek earlier in the year.\n\nWe're excited to support the ecosystem with this new tool!\n\nSome early observations include:\n1. GPT-OSS is extremely off the charts. It's on track to be one of the top downloaded models of all time, despite implementation complexity and fairly large sizes (20 & 120B)\n2. @MiniMax_AI M2.1 is outperforming most of the recent large Chinese models: @Kimi_Moonshot K2 Thinking is on-track to be in the top 10, DeepSeek v3.2 is underperforming past DeepSeek releases, and @Zai_org GLM 4.7 isn't breaking through as much as I originally thought.\n3. @NVIDIAAI's Nemotron Nano 3 from Nvidia (30B total, 3B active) is off to a strong start, maybe the best of any Nemotron model to date.\n4. OCR models like DeepSeek OCR and @allen_ai's OlmoCR 2 are overperforming. Quietly one of Ai2's most impactful releases yet.\n\nHere's an abbreviated list of the top 10 models per size category (full list on the website):\n- <1B - Mostly Qwen small models + SmolLM2, gemma-3-1b-it\n- 1-5B - Qwen 1.5B/3B, Llama 3.2 1B/3B, Phi-3-mini, gemma-2-2b\n- 7-9B - Llama 3.1/3/2 8B variants, Qwen 7B, Mistral 7B\n- 10-50B - gpt-oss-20b, Qwen 14B/32B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B, Mixtral 8x7B, Llama Vision 11B\n- 50-100B - Llama 70B variants, Qwen3-Next-80B, Qwen 72B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B\n- 100-250B - gpt-oss-120b, Mixtral 8x22B, Mistral Large, Llama-4-Scout, Qwen3-235B, MiniMax-M2\n- 250B+ - Llama 405B, DeepSeek R1/V3 variants, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.6\n\nWe use median instead of mean because outliers can skew averages dramatically. For example, the 1-5B bucket at 30d has a single outlier (Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct at 50.5M) that skews the mean from 0.57M to 5.51M — nearly 10x. Using median + IQR (interquartile range, 25th-75th percentile) gives more representative reference values, which gives a simple metric to understand if a model is on track to be a top model in the ecosystem.",

      "content_html": "<p>Every individual AI consultant I talk to (including myself) is massively changing their business approach in 2026.</p>\n<p>2023 was about learning the new world. What is prompting. Should we ban this. What is a model. How do they work. Task force creation. Get a license for a few hundred employees then scale to an enterprise license.</p>\n<p>2024 was multimodal. Expanded feature usage. Efficiency with GPTs. Stored prompts. More image/vision.</p>\n<p>2025 was agents. Or at least early agents. It was figuring out how to make AI do stuff. Meaningful delegation. Reallocation of 0-20% of tasks. Bigger org structure shifts. Some AI enterprise license shifts as some players jumped ahead.</p>\n<p>2026 is multimodal agents and AI as a teammate. It’s burning down old workflows and process re-engineering. It’s moving away from retrofit tech and more toward net-new creation. It’s disposal and just-in-time software.</p>\n<p>This is a big year for competing re-inventing how work gets done.</p>\n<p>Growth mindset and systems thinking are the two biggest skills to curate.</p>"
